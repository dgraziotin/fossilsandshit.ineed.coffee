					<description><![CDATA[Several years ago I was looking semi-seriously at building a 3d-printer (step-daughter on gap year ; bedroom for office/ workshop space ; but the wife stole the room for her night-school study instead). One motivation was explicitly to be able to make &quot;virtual endocasts&quot; of, for example, the reptile fossils of the Elgin-Lossiemouth sandstones, which classically &lt;em&gt;aren&#039;t there&lt;/em&gt;.
One thing that became clear to me is that there is a wide, and confusing, array of file formats available for stages of the process ; a wide and confusing array of programs for collecting / manipulating the data ; and no clear path to designing your toolchain. If I&#039;d been particularly interested in becoming an expert in 3d-printing, that would be great ; but I&#039;m more interested in getting (say) another &quot;Lizzie&quot; out of the rock without destroying the fossil.
Unless things have changed significantly in the last couple of years, there is a definite need for guidance through this morass, otherwise people will get excessively buried in the details.
Some years ago there was a comparable situation with respect to &quot;stitching&quot; photographs together to make large and-or panoramic images. I returned to this more recently and discovered the &quot;Hugin&quot; project, which collapses a toolchain of Open Source elements into a much more coherent whole, which can be easily navigated. Sure, each step has lots! (&quot;!&quot; implying &quot;factorial &quot; here! (but not here[exclaim]) of options, but the overall path is well established.
That, IMHO, is a step that the 3d-processing world needs to take.]]></description>
