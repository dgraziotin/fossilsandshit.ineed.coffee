Hey Helen! I hope the paper helps a bit at least. Do let me know if you have any questions or anything. Always happy to talk about peer review and publishing more in general too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What an interesting concept, I&#039;m off to take a look at the paper now! I&#039;ve always struggled with the arguments for and against open access and can find myself jumping from one side of the fence to the other. I can see there are plenty of benefits but equally I&#039;m not sure how well it fits in with the current system of peer review and publishing. Not that there aren&#039;t a plethora of problems with this too, but something needs to shift in order for it to work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very rare to get the opportunity to collaborate with people from so many countries and disciplines. It was a fascinating process watching the document evolve and grow as we all worked on it, and watching new collaborators come in at different times. None of this would have been possible without the platform or the community. I very much enjoyed the whole process!]]></description>
