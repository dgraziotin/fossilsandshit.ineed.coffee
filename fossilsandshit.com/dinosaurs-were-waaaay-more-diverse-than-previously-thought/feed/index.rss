					<description><![CDATA[Without quantification of serial variance in teeth, which exists in several of the taxa identified in this study, tooth samples cannot always be adequately placed. A good example of this would actually be shark teeth, in which serial variation of uppers and lowers is well-documented in fossil samples only when arrays of teeth, preserved from single individuals, are found. Theropod teeth, however, are commonly considered to be found due to incidental shedding, and thus finding them in series rare, and thus positional variation difficult to affirm. I think this issue should be resolved before designating any further tooth-based taxon. I tend to treat them as parataxonomic entities for now.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wear is a function of the hardness of the substrate (ie prey).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hmmmm, I see your general point, but ... describing the siliceous phytoliths (spelling?) in grasses as &quot;prey&quot; is stretching English a bit. Before the grasses came along (a post-Cretaceous development) there may have been other relatively hard-wearing plant tissues. Anyone know? The hadrosaurs had some reason to make those impressive tooth-batteries, after all.
But let&#039;s think as bit more about it. If you&#039;ve got a population of teeth from a particular context (litho- and hopefully chrono- stratigraphic), then you might find generalised tooth-to-tooth wear on one facet of the tooth, while tooth-to-food wear would probably be more evenly on both facets. Which I was thinking might give you an orientation of the teeth in the jaw ; but on second thoughts if you get tooth-tooth wear on the lingual facets in one jaw segment [mandible, dentary], then the corresponding teeth in the [dentary, mandible] would have wear on the buccal facets. 
So that&#039;s not going to help so much with grouping teeth into possible sets.]]></description>

Goodness, good question. Both will vary according to diet. Wear is a function of the hardness of the substrate (ie prey). Overall geometry is supposed to reflect trophic style to some degree, although this hasn&#039;t ever been rigorously quantified, as far as I&#039;m aware..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A slightly more serious response to question (2) &quot;What if different teeth represent different feeding styles within allopatric (different geographical areas) members of the same species?&quot;
Before you get to differing tooth shapes from allopatric feeding style variation, wouldn&#039;t you go through differing tooth &lt;strong&gt;wear&lt;/strong&gt; patterns first?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please forgive - I am weird:
1)    
Should we assign species names to remains that are distinct, but only known from teeth remains?  Yes, something to sink your teeth into.
2)
    What if different teeth represent different feeding styles within allopatric (different geographical areas) members of the same species?  That would bite.
3)
    Do individuals have several different tooth morphotypes, or is all variation representative of between-species differences? That argument is growing a little long in the tooth. 

Had to, sorry, wait too serious!  Good post, though,
