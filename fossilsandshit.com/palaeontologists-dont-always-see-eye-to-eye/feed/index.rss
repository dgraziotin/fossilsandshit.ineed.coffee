Ah yes, good point! I should have distinguished more between Editors/Reviewers and Publishers. I acknowledge that often Editors provide invaluable assistance in manuscript improvements, but it appears in this case, they missed out quite a bit as otherwise these comments wouldn&#039;t be so challenging! Maybe I should get something actually published first though before being too critical.. :p]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just one minor critique of your closing few sentences - without being able to view the original submitted version of the paper, we actually have no idea how much the initial reviewers did (or did not) improve the manuscript. I can confidently say that my own published work has been improved by pre-publication review (with the improvements ranging from quite minor to major). Of course, the journals themselves usually add little value (other than a citeable venue and pretty layout - content is strictly between me, the reviewers, and the volunteer editors)!]]></description>
