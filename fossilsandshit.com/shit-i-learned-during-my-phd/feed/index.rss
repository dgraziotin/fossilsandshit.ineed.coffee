I don&#039;t see the two as conflicting. No reason why you can&#039;t develop your strengths, and turn your weaknesses into new strengths too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with all but the last.  From the perspective of getting job, unless the weakness is a complete showstopper, I&#039;d say forget it.  Rather, if you know you have a strength, do everything you can to emphasize it and extract every piece of value from it. No one will hire you on the basis of your fairly well patched weaknesses.  They hire you for your strengths. Don&#039;t try to cut against the grain, spend your time getting better in the areas where you&#039;re already good]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with most of these points, but I really disagree with &quot;Having a relationship during your PhD is insanely difficult&quot;! Of course, Jon, as you&#039;ve already pointed out in replies to comments above, this is all based on your own experience, and no-one can or should expect you to write from any other perspective. So I am really not having a go at you here - but I guess my comment is aimed at the newbie PhDs who may read this post and freak out when they read that sentence...

You *can* have a successful relationship during your PhD. I have managed it, and many, many people I know have too, with little difficulty. Granted, I was in a long-term relationship before starting my PhD, and can see how starting a new one may be hard when you&#039;re already involved in a different kind of committed relationship with your thesis...! And like others have commented, there really can be a work-life balance. You just have to work at it a bit. I set out to maintain a good work-life balance when I started my PhD, because shit went down during my undergrad degree and I realised life was too short not to have, well, a life (more detail on my own blog post on the subject, here: http://wp.me/p2pjD9-fl). I don&#039;t think you should set out thinking that you cannot have a life outside of your PhD, because all that will do is set you up for feeling incredibly guilty every time you take an evening off.

But, of course, this all depends on the kind of person you are, and the situation you&#039;re in. I simply wanted to relay my own experiences here so that any new PhDs reading this are aware that there is a choice, and you&#039;re certainly *not* expected to work every waking hour, despite the pressure that your lab/supervisor/social media may appear to put on you to do so.]]></description>

Australian PhDs are officially 3 (and a bit) years full time, but often work out closer to 4 years. I studied part time and took 7 years, 3 months. As a mature aged student, I can say that it was intellectually the hardest thing I&#039;ve ever done, but not the hardest life experience I&#039;ve had.]]></description>

Ah, I should say that&#039;s based on experience in the UK where they run much shorter!]]></description>
