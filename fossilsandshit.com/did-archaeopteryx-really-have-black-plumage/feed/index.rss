Cool, thanks for the clarification on the stats - must have missed that bit too :/

Might have been a bit pissed off seeing all those images of a completely black Archaeopteryx popping up over the web, and it&#039;s clearly made me make a few mistakes here in the assessment! 

Cheers again for all the comments - look forward to seeing more coloured dinosaurs in the future!]]></description>

Yes, the Archaeopteryx data really predicts black to 95% probability. What you&#039;re referring to is the model&#039;s cross-validation accuracy, an entirely different statistic which as we state in our Methods is 80%.

The coloration of flight feathers in extant birds is almost exclusively due to melanins. One notable exception to this is the unique metalloporphyrins in the family Musophagidae - although even in this case the pigments&#039; presence has been found to be masked by black melanin when there is codeposition (McGraw &#038; Hill 2006).]]></description>

Hey Ryan, thanks for commenting and clarifying the above points!

Dean Lomax informed me as well that the feather might not actually be from Archaeopteryx too; I should have said that it was the media portraying the entirely black reproduction. That was more what I was frustrated with (will they ever actually get it right??)

Is it really to 95% probability though? If you construct a &#039;confusion matrix&#039; where the percentage of specimens that are correctly and incorrectly assigned to their pre-defined groups is shown, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll get a 95% success rate. You can see it qualitatively just by drawing envelopes that encapsulate 95% of the specimen points in discriminant space.

Cheers for the clarification on the pigment types - my fault entirely for missing that bit! Is it strictly just melanosomes that predict colour of pennaceous feathers/flight feathers in extant birds then?

					<description><![CDATA[Jon, to clarify:

1. While we provide evidence that the isolated feather was black with 95% probability, we do not claim that “Archaeopteryx possessed an entirely black plumage.”

2. We discuss melanins vis-à-vis other plumage pigments in our Discussion section: “It is improbable that either of the other major classes of feather pigments, carotenoids and porphyrins, were also present in the Archaeopteryx feather, as they are relatively uncommon (4) and generally do not occur in flight feathers, presumably for structural reasons (23,32). Additionally, even if there were codeposition of another pigment, the black melanin would likely mask its presence (4). Indeed, the melanic residue is ubiquitous throughout the feather vanes, and no banding patterns (15) are visible.”

3. Please refer to our cited references (Clarke et al 2010, Li et al 2010) for further information about the quadratic discriminant analysis we employed.

4. We provide information on the canonical axes in our Methods section: “Canonical axis 1 explained 71.32% of the variation and was most strongly associated with long axis; canonical axis 2 explained 17.23% of the variation and was most strongly associated with short axis.”

Sincerely,
Ryan Carney]]></description>
