Thanks for the ReadCube link. I also don&#039;t have a ResearchGate account because reasons http://fossilsandshit.com/illegal-file-hosting-site-researchgate-acquires-massive-financial-investment/

The journal allows you to upload the AAM/postprint with zero embargo :) http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php?issn=1353-3452]]></description>

Oh, could you also archive a version of your paper to make it freely available please? I don&#039;t have access, and can&#039;t see one via Unpaywall! :)]]></description>

Great points, thank you Jaime! I&#039;ll read your paper too, that looks interesting.

It seems the new list is essentially paywalled too, fancy that. http://www.nature.com/news/pay-to-view-blacklist-of-predatory-journals-set-to-launch-1.22090?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews&amp;sf83795942=1 If the list is designed to protect authors from the Global Souths, who are more prone to falling victim to predatory publishers, I don&#039;t see how this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some valid commentary and discussion! Indeed, Beall has been opaque about his blog&#039;s closure [1], and the internet archive is not a suitable substitute. He raised awareness, but was so determined to &quot;grow&quot; his lists, that he failed to see that his criteria and their application in any consistent manner were a failure. So, it is not surprising if one or more entities listed sued him. The fact that Cabell&#039;s has confirmed that Beall has worked on the new &quot;blacklist&quot; as a &quot;consultant&quot; is troubling. In fact, Cabell has Tweeted conflicting and contradictory information, immediately reducing trust in its new commercial venture. The DOAJ list is also far from perfect. There is still alot of &quot;junk&quot; on there, but it seems to be the &quot;whitest&quot; of white lists among OA journals at the moment. I agree that transparency is key in the success of this new &quot;blacklist&quot;. Beall only achieved fame because his blog was open, for all to read and interpret freely, as academics do. But if Cabell makes their list - and even more importantly their selection criteria which I think are based on 65 criteria, &quot;smelling&quot; like a renovated Beall&#039;s list - then this is bad news, because it means that the list, and its criteria, are hidden. As bad as the opaque impact factor, and as opaque as the sell-out Publons will become.
