					<description><![CDATA[Dear Jon,
I read your article in the Guardian about Elsevier&#039;s corruption of Open Access and wonder if you are also following the variant of this corruption recently made known by Cody Hanson&#039;s work: the monitoring of scientists by user tracking on publishing platforms:

https://www.codyh.com/writing/tracking.html 

Technically, this may not be a surprise, an expectable disappointment, but it is the anchoring of surveillance capitalism at the heart of science when scientists are tracked in their information behavior and ultimately in their entire online lives in this way and science is then controlled with this data. And it is a corruption of Open Science if Open Access publications are also used for it as long as they are on the publishing platforms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jon, Hey, liked your peer review slides.  We are building a DLT based platform for linking, finding and citing all research artifacts and would love to explore the proof of concept idea you mentioned on your last slide.  Let me know if you&#039;d like to discuss.  Best. cm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Jon! I am Saloni Rose, a master&#039;s student specialising in Biological sciences from India. I will start my PhD next year. I was wondering if I should start a website i.e if I should buy a domain and host it.  Could you give me some tips ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a science communicator maybe you would be interested in my latest idea. 

Find my blog at http://www.scicommnetwork.wordpress.com and see what you think. It would be great if you joined the network, or just left some feedback regarding the idea.

Thanks!]]></description>
