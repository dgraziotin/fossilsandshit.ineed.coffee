					<description><![CDATA[Found your comment (and others related) as I was searching to see if anyone has reported that Academia.edu has access to google searches and then uses the information to push its &quot;services.&quot;  They have done exactly that to me and that crosses the line. I have no idea how they did it, but I am sure it is buried in their so-called privacy policy.

The facts: 
I was looking for a paper in a field very much unrelated to mine. Google offered it through a link to academia.edu and I was too lazy to VPN into my university to download it. So I created an account without logging in through google or facebook. I got the paper and I was happy. 

Then the emails starting coming. 80 emails in three months and counting. OK, it is spam and I was about to opt out of them.

But the last one disturbed me greatly. Why? Because it referred to a google search I made on a book I used as an undergraduate many many years ago. How did academia.edu know the contents of a google search I made? Is google sharing my searches and including identification that is highly unique as well as personal with academia.edu? The connection here is that my account is my google email address, but I never used my google password nor did I explicitly gave them permission to monitor me. 

I tried wading through their privacy policy and have no idea if it gives them authority to monitor my google searches. If it does, this is, in my opinion, an outrageous abuse of the trust we unwittingly have on those who provide services for free. I would expect Facebook or the NSA to pull something like this but a for-profit company? Maybe it is legal, but it sure as hell is outrageously unethical. 

BTW, I just logged into academia.edu. It is recommending me other papers because of that google search.

Screw it. I am cancelling my account with them. 

I suggest you do the same unless you are comfortable with the idea that someone can use your searches to directly track what you do and act based on that information. We need someone like Edward Snowden inside these companies. Only then will we know what they are doing. (&quot;yeah, there oughta be a law.&quot;)]]></description>
