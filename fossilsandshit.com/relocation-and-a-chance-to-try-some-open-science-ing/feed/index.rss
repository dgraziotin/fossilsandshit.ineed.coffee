Cheers for the info McDawg! I do foresee a change in the style of writing. It might be necessary just to actually get interest in the idea, as opposed to being outwardly cynical/critical about pretty much everything ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, Jon.

Loads of food for thought. I am hungry, about to cook dinner, so shall leave #chunk1 of my response today for starters.

After the out of the blue demise of the Science3.0 platform earlier this year (sniffs), I was lost in the blogosphere where to post my stuff. I posted a couple of posts on my personal blog that I hadn&#039;t posted on since 2010 in the interim. whilst my Science3.0 posts are mostly off the grid, they are on a laptop somewhere in London (power cord is missing, so I will chase up that line of inquiry again).

When I was approached by FigShare to blog about Open Science there, we reached a Gentleman&#039;s Agreement via email. (Upon reflection, it took a phone call a few weeks later to &quot;iron out the creases&quot;, as it were as to format, language, length etc.).

After submitting posts 1 &#038; 2 , it became clear that my personal writing style did not fit &quot;that glove&quot;.

#AFRSEFUTTOCK.

Given the options available, I changed my style of writing that I had gotten used to since 2007 when I started blogging (thanks to a massive nudge from Bora Zivkovic).. 

It took a few weeks to get used to it. Initially, I found this immeasurably unaccommodating from free-styling since 2007, but by post 4, I&#039;ve never looked back.

It&#039;s all about communication, whether it be online or offline, so that is my starter (chilli sauce still defrosting).

Where I can, I refine my style of writing into the style that I have too. 

*A separate outlet may have to be found for this, if (=when) needed&quot;

Having more than one bloggy output does come in handy.
