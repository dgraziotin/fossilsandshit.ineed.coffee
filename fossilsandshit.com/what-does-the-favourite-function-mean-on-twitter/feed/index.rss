					<description><![CDATA[I never quite understood the value of &#039;favorite-ing&#039; I can see the value of being able to view the &#039;favorite&#039; posts later. I have preferred to be reTweeted, that my comment gets greater viewership. 
I have seen some Tweeters &#039;favorite&#039; and reTweet. I am more so flattered when both are done.
If someone is willing to favorite I would think they would also want to share it with their followers. I am a bit disappointed when they like my posts enough to &#039;favorite&#039; but not to reTweet.

I have not &#039;favorite&#039;d but have occasionally reTweeted. I should begin to do both, to reTweet to show appreciation for being followed and to &#039;favorite&#039; to be able to find the most intriguing Tweets later.]]></description>

Yep, I don&#039;t really get the bookmarking idea either, despite it&#039;s popularity! Seeing as how browsers can now handle hundred of tabs opening simultaneously, I just create a series of things to read/tweet during the day. It&#039;s like a non-stop recycling library! The best of those simply go into Chrome bookmarks, simples.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t favourite anything, because I found I wasn&#039;t going back to read them. If I want to read something, I forward it to my inbox so that everything&#039;s in one place.

I had never thought of it being like a &quot;like&quot;, but that&#039;s a great idea. The tweet later one is good too, to save bursts of tweets. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use it as a quick way to trigger an IFTTT action to save the link in the tweet to my Pinboard.in account, with a tag so I know I need to get back to it later (plus I subscribe to Pinboard&#039;s archive feature, so the text from the linked page is scraped and archived in case the original site goes down/changes/etc).  Makes it a lot easier to quickly note things for later reading without spending too much time during the first pass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As for me I use it a variety of ways, mostly as a bookmark though. I usually retweet things I agree with. I have a response from a celeb marked as a favorite, as it&#039;s nice to look back over, it wasn&#039;t worth retweeting though. Sometimes I might want to respond to a tweet but be busy at the time, so save it for later.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I quite often use it in the same way as retweet, in that I like to use it to flatter the tweeter, but I don&#039;t necessarily want to clutter up my followers&#039; timeline. Like, if a hashtag I&#039;m following has a long series of jokes or something, it would piss off all my followers if I retweeted every one I found funny. But yeah, I mostly like it as an archiving tool for tweets that I found interesting.]]></description>
