I remember our meeting fondly, Samir! And stand by the words I said then. And yes to a non-alcoholic beer one day - I&#039;ve cut out drinking for the foreseeable future, just so I can keep a more steady mind through all this nightmare. Take care too, for now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,
 Let me just say this:We met  through Internet for an academic work.We met physically in Tromso ( Norway) for the Munin Conference.I remember that when I introduce myself to you ( you were keynote speaker), you just were very happy and hugged me ( even bestowing upon me the title of &quot; Global South Open Access Specialist).That gesture touched me as it proved to me one thing :  you are profoundly human PERIOD.People nowadays are mean and take your kindness for weakness.Keep on being yourself, you&#039;ll succeed.And next time we meet ,We&#039;ll have a beer ( non alcoholic that is ).Take care bro !!!!]]></description>
