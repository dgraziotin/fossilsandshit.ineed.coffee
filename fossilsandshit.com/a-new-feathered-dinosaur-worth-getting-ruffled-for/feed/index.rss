Sure, it&#039;s &lt;a&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; (that should work?) You might be interested in &quot;Colless&#039;s index of phylogenetic tree imbalance&quot; which relates discovered creatures to their impact on their trees.

And &lt;a&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; is an amusing Google Trend showing that it&#039;s all pretty recent...]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;Anchiornis&lt;/em&gt; is certainly an awesome li&#039;l dino :)

Yes please!! That would be absolutely awesome! Is the paper freely available?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aaaw, Anchiornis is my favorite, definitely. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If anyone has an idea about how to approach such a project, please do leave a comment or get in touch!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Would you be interested in a paper my husband did on sampling and media reports WRT non-avian dinosaurs? There are a few citations &#038; some data analysis that you might be able to use. 

And based on anecdotal evidence from colleagues and my own blog, I&#039;m pretty sure that it&#039;s mostly because feathery freaks are super-sexy and the public respond really well to them!]]></description>
