The theme park wopuld keep you in work for a little while! Though James Gurney has done the smart thing and managed to produce the mythos to go with his art and made the merch to go with it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/merry-christmas-11-by-himmapaan-on-deviantart/#comment-51&quot;&gt;mattvr&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you so much, Matt!  How interesting, someone else also recently mentioned the Pieck echoes!  I must admit that that was also my first acquaintance with the artist.  I can see what you mean, as Pieck was of course working very closely within the traditions of the &#039;Golden Age&#039; illustrators, who are among &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; own influences.

Now if someone would just have the idea of building a theme park based on my work, huh? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful stuff as usual Himma!

Reminds me a little of the work of Anton Pieck. 
There&#039;s a real ornamental feel to much of your stuff, as if you&#039;re portraying images from an old mythical tradition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much, Jon!  The baskets contain &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; fruit, but they are mostly filled with parcels: gifts of various kinds! You&#039;ll also notice a few bottles which may contain something to your liking. ;)

Small people of no specific description &lt;a href=&quot;http://fav.me/d31p9r7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seem&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fav.me/d3fsi96&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; occur in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fav.me/d365247&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my universe&lt;/a&gt;, as it were.  I suppose they may have something elvish about them, but they are also influenced by artists like William Heath Robinson and Andrej and Olga Dugina.]]></description>
