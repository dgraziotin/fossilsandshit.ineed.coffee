					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, yes I think we&#039;re mostly on the same page indeed. It&#039;s just that I sometimes despair of researchers claiming their articles should be published for free because they wrote them for free and the reviewers aren&#039;t paid either. I applaud all efforts to publish for free, but see few of them successful (for a notable exception, see https://www.jstatsoft.org/index, however). If we want open access to succeed, we have to be realistic and not expect other people to work for nothing. Publishing papers, making them known, and keeping them available in the long run, cost time and money. Either volunteers have to do it or researchers y have to find people who can do it for them at a reasonable price. New technology has made it easier than in the past, but even then it requires skills and - above all - time. This is why outsourcing the administrative/technical side is something every learned society should consider, if they want to remain nimble and scientific. :-) Best, marc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/the-term-article-processing-charge-is-misleading/#comment-2922&quot;&gt;Marc Brysbaert&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Marc, thanks for your comment. I agree with virtually everything you say, apart from this &quot;Claiming otherwise is doing researchers a disservice.&quot;, as we&#039;re talking about different models. What you&#039;re describing is one set of services, and in the case of UP we&#039;re talking about a different one. Both work, and attempting to discredit or undermine does little, rather than alienate and offend those who have succeeded in other models. There is space for diversity, and all this post is saying is that transparency can introduce some real compeition into that.

I think we both seem to agree on the fact that there is no fixed number, and the maximum charge (APC/SPF) should be within a certain threshold. As someone who used to work for a learned society, I also appreciate that there are different types of publishers with different revenue streams and outgoing costs that publishing factors into.

&quot;This is the reason why I think the only viable option to keep open science affordable is to have open access journals published by learned societies.&quot; - This is not a future I would object to, in most cases, as we know who they serve :)

&quot;This is why we must collaborate with commercial publishers.&quot; Not sure how this conclusion is reached. Bring things in house, use modern technology! Learn from the mistakes of the past, don&#039;t replicate them.&lt;

&quot;I just wanted to add a bit of realism to your blog.&quot; Bit rude, but thank you for your insight on this matter!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

we&#039;ve been through all these thoughts when we set up an open access journal with a learned society. Some members indeed wanted to get rid of APC at all for the reasons you state. However, it rapidly became clear that this was non-sustainable. The price Ubiquity Press charges for open access is indeed what it more or less costs them to keep their company going. However, it does not include final text editing (and we all know how bad we are with our reference list). So, either you don&#039;t care about this or the journal&#039;s editors have to do this in addition to their other work.

The price also does not include VAT or other taxes you have to pay. It does not compensate the editors in any way for the work they are doing (e.g., by giving them some money so that they can pay an RA to run experiments in the hours they spend on evaluating the ms). Finally, it includes a very basic submission portal, which involves a lot of extra hassle for authors, editors, and reviewers. 

It rapidly became clear that if you charge Ubiquity Press&#039;s basic cost, you are offering a very basic service and entirely depend on the editors&#039; idealism. This usually is a bad basis to keep the journal going for more than 10 years (sustainability is something else authors rightfully expect when they consider submitting a ms to your journal). In addition, it is not a system that can handle large numbers of manuscripts (I was editor of a journal that received 450 submissions per year and I can tell you that this is something completely different from getting 20 submissions per year; still the higher number ought to be your ambition if you want open access to florish).

All in all, we came to the conclusion that it is next to impossible to have a prosperous, sustainable open access journal with an APC of less than 1000 Euros. Claiming otherwise is doing researchers a disservice.

I fully agree with you, however, that an APCs above 1000 Euros says more about commerical companies&#039; greed than about their desire to promote science. This is the reason why I think the only viable option to keep open science affordable is to have open access journals published by learned societies. Commercial companies are always driven by profit maximalization for their management and shareholders. The past has learned us, however, that learned societies are ill suited to distribute the journals themselves (making sure that the website is up and running all the time, that articles are included in all possible databases, that APCs are paid, etc.). This is why we must collaborate with commercial publishers. If the learned society has the ownership of the journal, that is not a problem, because it can go to another publisher if the current one is starting to charge too much (because they want to increase their profit).

I hope I&#039;ve made clear I am entirely in favor of open access journals with the smallest possible APC. I just wanted to add a bit of realism to your blog.]]></description>
