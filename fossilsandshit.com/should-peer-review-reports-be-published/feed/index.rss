Hi Klaas, as I know you&#039;re aware of, I&#039;m not exactly happy with the current peer review system either! :) https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1151/v3

My experience of peer review has been largely positive, however. By this, I mean it has almost always invariably helped to improve the MS. While comments have sometimes been written in a manner that wasn&#039;t perhaps as civil as could be, the motivations of the reviewers has always been positive and constructive, and to me that&#039;s what matters. Palaeontology is a very small community though, and I suspect that we have different practices in review.

In several cases, however, I have received what I would call inadequate review - several lines of comments from a single referee on very large studies. But never what I would consider a &#039;harsh&#039; review, except for depth of criticism of my research. Which is a good thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/should-peer-review-reports-be-published/#comment-2822&quot;&gt;protohedgehog&lt;/a&gt;.

hi Jon, thanks alot for your encouraging words. My post-publication peer-review contained for example the following sentences. &quot;The review of reviewer 1 contains only two words. A response from the authors to reviewer 3 reveals that reviewer 1 has reviewed earlier versions. Details are lacking.&quot; This post-publication peer-review was published on 18 January 2017.

It can be read at http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/11/e012047.responses that BMJ Open has published on 13 February 2017 an apology about this issue and that since that day the full prepublication history has been updated. http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/11/e012047.draft-revisions.pdf is the direct link to all versions of this paper and http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/11/e012047.reviewer-comments.pdf is the direct link to all peer-reviews of all versions.

The review of R. Grant Steen on version 1 is harsh. &quot;This paper reads like an advertisement for BioMed Central (BMC). The manuscript touts BMCâ€™s adherence to COPE guidelines, its low overall rate of retraction, and its low rate of retraction specifically for dishonesty. Yet a low rate of retraction can arise in two ways; either editors are vigilant and weed out bad work pre-publication or editors are lax about oversight post-publication. It is impossible to know which process led to the low rate of retraction reported here. The fact that the paper was written by two people from the BMC Editorial office naturally led them to conclude that editorial oversight cannot be at fault. My experience with BMC journals has not been so positive that I want to help BMC conquer the world.&quot;

This review was thus not yet available when I was conducting my post-publication peer-review of the article by Elizabeth Moylan and Maria Kowalczuk. Would you mind to reveal if you have ever received from a peer-reviewer such a harsh review on any of your submitted manuscripts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BMJ Open is an example of an open access journal which is publishing alongside all articles the peer-review reports of all versions, together with the name of the reviewer and with the comments of the authors on all peer-review reports. 

I had noted some issues in http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/11/e012047 and I had therefore contacted the Editor-in-Chief of BMJ Open with a request for a copy of the ICMJE disclosure form of the guarantor of this article. The Editor-in-Chief responded with an invitation to submit an eletter. BMJ Open is a journal which is very willing to accept and publish eletters (responses / letters-to-the-editor / comments, etc.). There are no strict restrictions about the size of the text and/or about a deadline. See http://bmjopen.bmj.com/eletters 

I have therefore conducted an exhaustive post-publication peer-review of this article. It was during the preparation of this post-publication peer-review very valuable that I was able to have access to the peer-review reports. The peer-review reports even contained details which I was unable to locate in the article in question. I have subsequently submitted my post-publication peer-review as eletter to BMJ Open. It got soon accepted and it was soon afterwards publised at http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/11/e012047.responses#commentary-on-a-study-about-retraction-notices-in-journals-of-biomed-central 

A copy of the ICMJE form was not received, also not after reminders. I have thus decided to prepare a manuscript about the unavailability of this ICMJE form. This manuscript was rejected by 3 different preprint servers. It was therefore not possible to get feedback / reviews / comments from readers of a preprint version of this manuscript. 

The manuscript deals with a highly controversial topic. I have thus decided to submit a new version to a DOAJ-listed open access journal with no ties to any of the parties who are listed in my manuscript. This turned out to be a good strategy. My first attempt was immediately successful. The manuscript was quickly accepted by &#039;Roars Transactions, a Journal on Research Policy and Evaluation&#039;. This journal has no APC (so free to publish) and it is published by the &#039;UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano&#039; (in Italy). See https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/roars/article/view/9073

A short eletter to BMJ Open in which I refer to this new publication was quicky accepted and can be read through http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/11/e012047.responses  BMJ and both authors have until now not communicated with me about my paper at https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/roars/article/view/9073 A copy of the ICMJE form was until now never received.

So yes, publishing the peer-review reports with the names of the reviewers and with the comments of the authors on all peer-review reports of all versions of an article is very valuable.]]></description>
