					<description><![CDATA[My personal favourite RSS reader is The Old Reader. https://theoldreader.com/

It mimics most of the features of Google Reader, and imports images and video really well. I maintain one for following blogs I&#039;m personally interested in, and have used one for my social media management in healthcare work in the past. You can categorize blogs by custom topics and view all of them that way, or just read your whole stream.]]></description>
