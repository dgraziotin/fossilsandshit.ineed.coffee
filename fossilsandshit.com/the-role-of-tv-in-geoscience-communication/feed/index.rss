					<description><![CDATA[It helps me a lot that one of my better blog buddies (JMMcDowell) is an archeologist, so I can differentiate better.  I would have known anyway, but this is quicker.  I think of archeologist as working with architecture.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Firstly, I’m surprised by the small proportion of those who answered ‘Ross’ (the palaeontologist character from Friends)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wow. I can now answer at least one question about Friends in the next pub quiz.  Astonishing the useful things you learn in geology. Now all I need is the gastroliths to be able to stomach actually watching an episode. 
&lt;blockquote&gt; I imagine everyone reading this at least owns a TV,&lt;/blockquote&gt;Be careful of your assumptions. I only got a TV when I got married, and still use the radio more than the goggle box.]]></description>
