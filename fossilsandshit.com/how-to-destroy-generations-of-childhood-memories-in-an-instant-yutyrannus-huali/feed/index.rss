The default assumption should always be that things are the same unless one can demonstrate an actual difference based on clearly defined criteria. Unless you want to entirely redefine the protocols of scientific investigation. Perhaps you should reconsider the methodologies you have used in the past and see for yourself.
On another hand, attributing variability to developmental causes is also one step short of acknowledging the fact that no two individual organisms are absolutely identical, even true twins, considering the effect of phenotypic plasticity.
As for the phylogenetic analysis: results are never better than the data and you have accurately pointed out already that it was gathered in a somewhat clumsy manner. The result of it is that the paper makes the news, gets discussed and thus gathers more attention from the general public and a broader panel of scientists than just dinogeeks. All in all, I think it is a very &quot;successful&quot; analysis, but not for scientific reasons, perhaps we should remember that and get training on writing errata as well as papers ;)]]></description>

I know nothing whatsoever about the systematics of tyrannosaur-grade taxa. I&#039;m more concerned that Nature, and many other journals, are consistently letting half-arsed attempts at cladistic or phylogenetic analyses through. I mean, it&#039;s not that difficult in theory or practice, and is a core part of Palaeontology!!]]></description>

The default assumption should never be that they&#039;re the same!! There is evidence to show that they are different, with respect to how they&#039;ve scored the three specimens (see the Supplementary Data), as well as qualitatively in the main text, where variations are attributed to ontogenetic allometry.

147 species concepts..whew! Do you know how many of these concepts are applicable to fossil taxa?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;although the Supplementary Data seems to suggest the authors donâ€™t even know which quarry theyâ€™re from!! *alarm bells*

Bought from a dealer.

Of course, that doesn&#039;t mean they weren&#039;t found on the same slab. I&#039;m on holiday, means, on the wrong side of the paywall.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The three specimens show differences in their cranial morphology, in the context of gross dimensionality and relative structural position. Assuming that these are not artefacts of burial-induced deformation (as is persistent in almost all known dinosaurian skulls), the authors postulate these to be ontogenetic variations. If the three specimens were not so closely associated, this should instantly be a cause for concern to palaeontologists,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

...though, in the absence of evidence that they&#039;re different taxa, the default assumption should be that they&#039;re the same.

&lt;blockquote&gt;and relates back to the question of rigorously defining species in the fossil record.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ha. As of February 2009, there were 147 species concepts out there; depending on the species concept, there are from 101 to 249 endemic bird species in Mexico. Most species concepts aren&#039;t applicable when you lack enough specimens to do some approximation of population biology.

Long story short: forget about it. Identify clades, name them, and ignore species. Too bad the ICZN insists you must pretend to identify species anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say that I came into the &lt;i&gt;Yutyrannus&lt;/i&gt; explosion a little later than I would have liked but, although it is quite clearly a sensational animal, I agree with you, Darren Naish and Andrea Cau (amongst others) that there are clear phylogentic concerns and question marks regarding this taxon.

I also have to say that I&#039;m not very impressed regarding the provenance of the specimens either and it would not surprise me in the least if other &quot;concerns&quot; will raise their heads in the next few years as the specimens are more intensely studied and the full osteology becomes apparent.

Great post Jon!]]></description>
