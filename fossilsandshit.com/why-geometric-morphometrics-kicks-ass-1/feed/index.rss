Thank you for your comments Luis! (Wordpress originally identified it as spam!!)

Nothing wrong with shameless self-promotion either - what do you think this blog is? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jonathan!

Most of the arguments that you refer are totally true concerning the advantages of geometric morphometrics.
I have used and taught it.
I have a comment though on the use of ratios, specially your statement ‚ÄúRatios are also a statistical over-simplification. The combination of measurements that can produce the same ratio is constrained only by the size of an object‚Ä¶‚Äù.
Although this problem is know for long, remember Pearson concerns on the use of ratios, in the 80‚Äôs a new group of techniques solved most of those ‚Äúproblems‚Äù. That package named as Compositional Data Analysis (CDA) allows the use of proportions and other sort of closed data.
You can check the recently state of the art book on CDA published by Wiley and Sons http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470711353.html and if you forgive me the shameless self promotion you can also check the paleontological application of CDA in flying vertebrates in here:
