Someone else asked that question too. Apparently, despite the proximity of the &#039;islands&#039; to the sea, he had not considered groundwater chemistry, dynamics, etc., which was a little bit odd. They were all bunged into a simple metric of pair-wise distances, I think..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice report jon. I think i will overlook the mentions of continental accents as if it were a bad thing, rather than a display of sexyness. I wondered: in the talk that mentioned lakes as islands when it comes to biogeographical pattern, were subterranean lakes treated separately or even simply considered?]]></description>

Yeah, I vaguely remember it but would have to look it up again, would recommend the book by Hammer though, it explains some of the techniques very well, though is admittedly expensive. As for the type 1 question, I did answer correctly once I had it explained ot me at least :) As I mentioned in my last post there were a few other techniques I wanted to try, including the one you mentioned and the use of semilandmarks but had a few time-related issues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool, there&#039;s a link to PAST on the Links part of this webby. I still think MorphoJ is probably better though, or at least has an easier interface. Yes, your methods were more than fine, it&#039;s just I think you missed the final step, with the actual deformation visualisation. There has to be some software out there that can do 3D thin-plate splines, or an equivalent, right..? The alternative procedure I mentioned is actually that really rudimentary thing we did during the MSc if you remember..?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon, I used the program PAST for my morpho stuff, which is also free off the internet with an easy to understand manual and you can get Palaeontological data analysis by Oyvind Hammer off Amazon, etc. as a good guide to the various statistical methods present in PAST. Also Norm suggested the Procrustes PCA method though there were other things I wanted to experiment with if I had more time No worries about the morpho comment, I know I shoulda known that one particularly as I revised it for our vivas. There&#039;s a chance I my be presenting this to Mike Benton and the rest of the Bristol palaeo lecturers at some point so I will definitely have that locked down if I do.]]></description>
