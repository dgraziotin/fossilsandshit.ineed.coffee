					<description><![CDATA[A couple of years ago I was looking at the idea of building a 3d printer - a RepRap, or something similar - with the idea of making (scale) models of fossils, endocast cavities etc. The wife vetoed the project, but I tihnk it would have worked, if I could have worked out the tool chain from MRI (or whatever; CT ...) scans to a 3d modelling language that was supported. 
Having said that, I see a recent (last few days) flurry of lawsuits between the manufacturers of proprietary, closed-source 3d printers. Which makes me glad that I didn&#039;t jump in feet-first to just buy a machine and was planning on building my own to open standards.
What do you think the market for such products would be - both for research and for teaching?]]></description>
