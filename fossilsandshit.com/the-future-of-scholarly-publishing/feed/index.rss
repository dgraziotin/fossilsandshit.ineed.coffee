					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] we were to have to invent the scholarly publishing system again from scratch today, what would it look like?  Our current system of publishing is basically identical to that of what it was in the 1990s, before the emergence of a vast array of internet-based technologies, loosely termed Web 2.0. A research paper is a 20th century format, published in a 17th century container &#8211; the journal.  Ironically, this system still persists despite the blatant fact that anyone can publish anything they want at the touch of a button these days. Yet scholarly publishing still usually takes months, and some times takes even years, just to upload content to the Web.&#160; [&#8230;]]]></description>
