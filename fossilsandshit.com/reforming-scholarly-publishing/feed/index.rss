					<description><![CDATA[These developments are not mutually exclusive with plan S, in my personal opinion. By intending to modify the frames of research evaluation, the funders open the way to increasing for researchers the relevance of such platforms, some of these funders already support, incidentally. You could see the measures proposed in plan S as the first step towards a broader transition. The horizon can be wider, as European and non-European initiatives show, indeed. However, building this horizon should be a shared responsibility, not only of funders but also of libraries and research communities. At their level, the funders by pushing through plan S, create a landscape where this shared responsibility can be enacted upon to strive for a change (also financially, by creating a transition on how money is spent in the R&#038;P deals). Again, this implies that there is an agreement on the models the research community would like to build, and that is not the responsibility of the funders alone. The path is long, let us not confound this first step with the horizon to reach, and maybe neglect its relevance because of that.]]></description>
