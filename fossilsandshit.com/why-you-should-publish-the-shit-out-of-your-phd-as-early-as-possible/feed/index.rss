					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree. If the data make sense and you have a mature understanding (or at least a rough understanding) of what is going on, go and publish asap. A paper also gives you the freedom to attend highly-esteem conferences and talk freely about your research without being worrying that others will ste your work. They might get good ideas for further research but you might also gain collaborations which lead to more papers (as a co-author). Also having papers means that the PhD viva will be easy, sweet and enjoyable. Also papers give confidence, and confidence leads to success.]]></description>

The simple answer is, how do we avoid plagiarism - citation! Publish, blog about your work - just make sure that you appropriately cite all sources, including your own, to avoid any conflicts. It&#039;s just good scholarship :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for sharing your experience! Unfortunately, this advise came a bit too late for me, but I am sure it will help many other PhD students.

There are so many things which I wish I had known before I started my PhD. Of course, some mistakes and experiences are inevitable. But so many problems could be avoided, foreseen or simplified by passing on the experience and knowledge of the (almost) graduated PhDs, postdocs and professors to the newbies. In my opinion, this should be the task of the advisor but it seems that this is either not wanted or ignored or forgotten. I have stumbled upon so many good practice guidelines and advises after it was already too late to follow them, because before I was not aware of certain issues and problems.]]></description>
