					<description><![CDATA[What a great initiative! Was totally under my radar until now. The proposed structure looks good! I can imagine this being relevant to scientists in every stage of their career, and even a generic audience with an interest in Science (and Arts, Humanities, Social, etc.) What would it take to bring this to the masses? 

A VLE/LMS platform to host the MOOC? There are some free and Open, and some that originate from Universities and that are now run as business. 
To create awareness and sign-ups exposure and advertising comes in handy.
And what about people to do some coordination and/or maintenance? 

All in all, to take it further, some kind of (formal) organisation and with that a budget seems inevitable... So involvement from Academies, PhD Councils, Funding Organisations would be great, and what about corporate sponsors? So many ideas, I will drop more in the Google Doc soon.]]></description>
