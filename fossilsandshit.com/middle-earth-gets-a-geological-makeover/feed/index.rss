Hehe entire paleontology of Middle-earth too :). The period known as Spring of Arda would be like one of the &quot;earlier geological eras&quot;, maybe carbon or jurassic period, (there were &quot;grasses and great ferns, and trees whose tops were crowned with cloud as they were living mountains, but whose feet were wrapped in a green twilight. And beasts came forth and dwelt in the grassy plains, or in the rivers and the lakes, or walked in the shadows of the woods. As yet no flower had bloomed nor any bird had sung, for these things waited still their time in the bosom of Yavanna; but wealth there was of her imagining, and nowhere more rich than in the midmost parts of the Earth, where the light of both the Lamps met and blended.&quot; so sounds quite prehistoric, imagining prehistoric fern trees, that was maybe the dinosaur age for Arda :), after all the fell beasts were &#039;creature of an older world&#039;:

&quot;A creature of an older world maybe it was, whose kind, lingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood, apt to evil&quot;
...
&quot;Pterodactyl. Yes and no. I did not intend the steed of the Witch-King to be what is now called a &#039;pterodactyl&#039;, and often is drawn (with rather less shadowy evidence than lies behind many monsters of the new and fascinating semi-scientific mythology of the &#039;Prehistoric&#039;). But obviously it is pterodactylic and owes much to the new mythology, and its description even provides a sort of way in which it could be a last survivor of older geological eras.&quot;)

This time period would be also the origin of coal, jet and amber deposits :) (Dwarves in The Hobbit are mentioned &quot;...go back to digging coal&quot;, jet gems are used by Teleri elves to adorn their ships with &quot;beaks of gold and eyes of gold and jet.&quot;, amber is mentioned only in the Book of Lost Tales though :))]]></description>

Ehem (Puts on Computational &#038; Systems Biologist hat).

They would not be different &quot;Species.&quot; This would mean that they could not interbreed, which obviously they could.

What you have are what we now call &quot;Ethnicities&quot; (prior word of usage was &quot;Race&quot; - but that, in Middle-earth would apply more to Humans, Elves, Hobbits, and Goblins/Orcs respectively, being able to interbreed, but having significantly different Phenotypical and Genotypical traits) of Goblins.

Tolkien also, in &quot;The History of Middle-earth, vol 12: The Peoples of Middle-earth&quot; speculated in an essay to himself that the Orcs were a product probably of a perverted race of men, and that elves may have interbred with them to produce a longer lived type of Orc - called &quot;Boldoeg&quot; by Tolkien.]]></description>
