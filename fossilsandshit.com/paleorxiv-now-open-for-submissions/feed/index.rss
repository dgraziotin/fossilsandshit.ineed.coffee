Let&#039;s go with June just to be on the safe side :) And I would love a submission from you all, either as part of the pre-launch set, or after we&#039;ve gone live!

Best,

Jon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great initiative, hope to contribute with this in the near future! (with a submission or in any other way that may be useful). I know that the launch date is imminent, but do you have a more specific date? something like this month or June or July, is more than enough. I could use that kind of information to persuade co-authors to submit an almost finished manuscript.
Thanks for your efforts.]]></description>
