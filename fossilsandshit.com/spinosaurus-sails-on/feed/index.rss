					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/spinosaurus-sails-on/#comment-452&quot;&gt;Duane Nash&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Duane, thanks for your comment! 

Would it not be equally possible for the specimens to represent two (or more) sub-adult specimens in that case too?

I think it would have been difficult to disassociate a comparative discussion between Sigilmassasaurus and Spinosaurus without addressing some of the issues with the proposed neotype specimen. 

And yep, it is possible to find the Science article, if you&#039;re one of the lucky people to have an institutional login! It&#039;s a pity the original article wasn&#039;t made freely available to everyone given that there was such a huge media storm around it. Missed opportunity again there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a 100 page paper (Evers et al.) to gloss over the bone histology data from the Ibrahim et al. supplementary data - which shows congruence in growth stage in BOTH the vertebral and appendicular elements - is a noticeable omission. That both the vertebral elements and appendicular elements suggest subadult growth stage speaks against a chimeric origin. The Evers paper would have been much better served if it concentrated on making the case for Sigilmassasaurus as a distinct taxa rather than making a whole-scale (but rather weak and less than comprehensive) assault on the Ibrahim et al. neotype, collection method, chimera argument etc etc.  

It is also possible to find the complete Ibrahim et al. article online: http://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Martill/publication/265553416_Semiaquatic_adaptations_in_a_giant_predatory_dinosaur/links/545361430cf2bccc4909c198.pdf
as well as the more in-depth supp materials: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2014/09/10/science.1258750.DC1/Ibrahim.SM.pdf]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/spinosaurus-sails-on/#comment-448&quot;&gt;protohedgehog&lt;/a&gt;.

Just sticking to the Moroccan &quot;Kem Kem&quot; deposit (the name rings a bell, but I haven&#039;t researched this), would it not be feasible to encourage the Moroccan Geology Ministry (if there is such - given the prevalence of oil along North Africa, I would be surprised if there were nothing) to encourage local commercial collectors to record such data in return for being in some way &quot;licensed&quot; - the carrot part of the equation being that properly provenanced and recorded commercial fossils would hopefully attract a higher price on the market?
Sounds hopelessly idealistic, I know. Particularly if you combine Arabic love of &quot;baksheesh&quot; with African bureaucratic efficiency. (I&#039;ve spent too long working in the Middle East and Africa to have many illusions left.)
That said, I know almost nothing about the commercial fossil trade. I was brought a plaster cast of a Calymene in the early 1970s, and I&#039;ve picked up (and put down) a couple of Moroccan trilobites in various rock shops. I know professors who have spent hundreds of quid on fish fossils (in the 1980s!), but I prefer each item in my rock pile to have it&#039;s own story of when I found it. For example : the unwritten First Law of the Rock Hound being &quot;Look before you piss.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a back log ;)

Yes, some sort of collecting standards would be useful, but I imagine they would be difficult to implement when the fossil trade is such a big deal in North Africa, for commercial reasons. Simple guidelines on documentation would have to come from a higher power, such as any local palaeo groups or perhaps someone involved in the policy aspects of such things.

Yes, Baryonyx is considered to be a spinosaurid, I believe, and part of its own subfamily. There&#039;s also a Thai spinosaurid awaiting publishing, so these guys probably were quite cosmopolitan during the &#039;middle&#039; Cretaceous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Busy little blogger today, aren&#039;t you?
So, what is needed is more digging and more specimens - with better documentation of find localities and interrelationships.
Wasn&#039;t the British discovery Baryonyx incorporated into the Spinosauridae a while ago ... yes, Wikipedia seems to think so. [... thinks ...] But that&#039;s no big deal ; the (North) Atlantic didn&#039;t exist at the time, so Africa, Britain and the American West were all in relatively close proximity.]]></description>
