					<description><![CDATA[I often feel/ have felt the unnecessary language used in sciences, especially for papers.  A lot of what I have read in, say, psychological papers is almost a necessity to make the paper so difficult that the average person can read the words, but the meaning will elude him/her.  This is not good communication.  This is being somewhat conceited as a science.  People want to know what&#039;s going on and how and why...this is a way.  Just speak as a person would who didn&#039;t have a PH.D.
