Cheers Martin - I&#039;ll be sure to read them later when I&#039;m not at work :)

Actually, would you be able to send me a copy of your thesis please? It sounds like something I&#039;d be interested in reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for following my blog, Jon. When reading the notification email, the title of this post literally jumped off the screen at me because (for the benefit of other readers at least), as the subject of my MA dissertation last year, I chose to research the subject of climate change scepticism in the UK.

As it happens, I have recently posted 3 items on my blog summarising the introductory chapter of this; the third - and perhaps most relevant - of which is:  http://lackofenvironment.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/the-psychological-causes-of-denial/ 

However, I would recommend that you look at the comments - especially those of Barry Woods (a supposed &quot;sceptic&quot;) who is open-minded enough to post links to documents he does not agree with (such as those over 10 years old that support my argument).  

By the way, I also think it is Clive Hamilton that invented the phrase &quot;affluenza&quot; (or at least he wrote a book about it).]]></description>

Regular readers will know that one of common themes and bugbears is how the Left and right resort to economic growth to justify austerity or anti austerity policies. Its good to know that psychologically I am in right track and things are getting better even if it doesn&#039;t seem like it. As Hegel says, everything happens in time through a dialectic  between resistance and change, Freudian life and death instincts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;This materialistic state is apparently the direct cause of why nearly 25% of people in the UK were suffering from a mental illness last year, whereas this statistic is halved for mainland Europe who are less materialistic. Not being a master of the psychological literature, I have not been able to track down specific citations for this, but it is discussed here in a short (and accessible) publication by James. The cause of this association is apparently down to the conflation of â€˜wantsâ€™ with â€˜needsâ€™.&quot;

I asked him at the time -- he said it was a WHO survey that came up with this statistic. (And described it as being quite a rigourous, well adjusted survey, and mentioned a paper which discusses the way mental health is spoken of in various languages, and presents that as another potential cause for the startling disparity.)

Moreover, he was pointing out that it&#039;s the all-pervasive nature of advertising in our time that leads to this conflation. Advertising is one of the biggest industries in our country, and in the anglosphere generally, which is in the business of selling us as consumers. It&#039;s altering what we think we want or need: it&#039;s all about trying to use all sorts of clever neurobiological methods of altering what we think. Which, er, has a lot of implications. 

The Public Interest Research Centre, with the WWF, released a very interesting report into this last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pirc.info/projects/advertising/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Think Of Me As Evil&lt;/a&gt;. Highly worthwhile. George Monbiot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monbiot.com/2011/10/24/sucking-out-our-brains-through-our-eyes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in his blog and Graudina column&lt;/a&gt;, describes advertising as a poison that our society is hooked on. 

The nature of advertising is something we should be aware of (and, for it to work, something advertisers want us not to think about), and something we, as a culture, should discuss more.]]></description>
