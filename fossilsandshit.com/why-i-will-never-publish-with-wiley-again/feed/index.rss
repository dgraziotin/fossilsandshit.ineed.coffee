					<description><![CDATA[I had also multiple problems with my proofs from a wiley journal. They introduced multiple errors in my reference list (missing authors, changed the whole structure, inconsistent use of italics, missing second brackets, order of references etc. ) and multiple errors in spacing of the document. After I have corrected them, I asked for a second proof because I was doubtful. Again new and old mistakes in the manuscript, which I corrected again. This took me a lot of time and the best thing is that they gave me a deadline to notify if I have any further corrections of basically a few hours. I was really upset.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have paid 200 hundred dollars for manuscipt submission in Southern Economic Journal and the editor rejected it immediately without sending it to outside reviewers. I wrote to the editor to refund as Article Processing Charges (APCs) is appopriate for manuscripts that are accepted for publication by our external editors following peer review. But the editor did not accept paying back and even not answer my further mails.

In this circumstances it doesn&#039;t seem fair to me and in accordance with academic ethics to object to refund.What do you think?]]></description>

Hi Heather,

Thanks for this comment, it&#039;s great to have your experience and insight here! In terms of what to do, I totally agree with simply overlaying peer review onto the arXiv and other preprint servers. I actually wrote a bit about this for ScienceOpen, as that&#039;s one of the functions we can do there: http://blog.scienceopen.com/2016/04/what-if-you-could-peer-review-the-arxiv/ Would love any thoughts on that! :)

					<description><![CDATA[Agree with you about Wiley&#039;s cost and value (or lack thereof), however in my experience no one publisher or type of publisher has cornered the market on shoddy peer review. Ludicrous delays occur at not-for-profits; one editor I knew talked about moving to an outfit like Wiley because they were 5 years behind in publishing accepted articles in completed issues. A group I was part of submitted an article to a not-for-profit; our understanding is it was sent for peer review. When we inquired about progress two years later  (we were all that busy in the meantime), we did not get any response. I object to PLOS ONE and others attempt to fully  automated peer review and reduce review to a series of forced-choice questions and communicate with reviewers via a two-layer impersonal &quot;do-not-reply&quot; email process; I am unofficially boycotting PLOS ONE. What to do? I think we should all move to an arXiv style automatic posting of preprints so that the often silly business of peer review for career brownie points does minimum damage to actually advancing our knowledge, as an interim step towards more radical change in conducting and sharing research. Thank you for sharing your experience, John.]]></description>
