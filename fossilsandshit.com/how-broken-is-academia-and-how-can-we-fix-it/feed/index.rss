Hah!  Get your PhD, work as a postdoc 3 years, and people will start asking why you don&#039;t have a child to take advantage of the maternity leave being an allowable career break, or a way to extend the lifetime of a fellowship/grant.  #sciencingwhilefemale

					<description><![CDATA[As requested on Twitter, I&#039;d like to add that some of the power and exclusion happens before the graduate school level as well. Graduate study is a very privileged endeavor. Many would-be students don&#039;t make it to grad school (or even undergrad) because they do not think it is for &quot;people like them&quot;, whether that is based on race or gender or political ideology or disability or family or lifestyle or something else. I think that might change if power were shared by more diverse people, both in identity and ways of life, but for right now it&#039;s easy to be discouraged from even trying if the model for success is white and male. 

One example that I&#039;ve seen is a focus for women on being childless / relationship-less if they want to succeed in academia. I actually went to one panel on &quot;how to succeed in grad school&quot; for graduate students in my field just a few short years ago, and the major advice was &quot;if you&#039;re a woman, don&#039;t get into a romantic relationship and don&#039;t get pregnant and definitely don&#039;t have a child because your career will be over&quot;. For one other grad student who was there, she actually asked me if I thought she should just drop out of grad school because she was married and thinking about having kids. Just that one panel discussion caused one brilliant student to question her choices - how many more heard similar things and never even went? 

I know graduate school is not the right choice for everybody, but no one who wants to try it should be excluded based on not fitting some extant definition of what &quot;success&quot; looks like.]]></description>
