Oops, sorry Bea! I did mean largely from the MSc though - the MRes is slightly different I guess, as you&#039;re geared towards doing more research as part of a leap towards continuing in academia, so publishing is more expected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am really glad when i saw this article, am one of a lots of students that even had the zeal to publish their masters thesis, either high publication fees and other bureaucracy, and my question goes thus whats actually the difference between publishing someones work in Open Access Journals and other journals that demands high publication fess. And also it will be of great help to me and to other, if you can or anyone can list some great reputable Open Access journals. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the process of writing an article from my MA-thesis... I just find it so hard and time consuming, especially as I have a full time job as well... Trying to get as much done as possible in the weekends, but it will take a while..! Not to mention that my thesis of 17 500 words will have to, somehow, be shrunken down into a mere 6000 words... But I find you post encouraging and will try and persevere! Good luck to you as well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Emma, first of all congratulations on completing an interesting and informative masters! Second, thank you for wanting to make sure it doesn&#039;t slip through the cracks. Getting a publication on your record at this early stage can only help you down the line.

I&#039;ll be happy to do what I can to help you through the process. I&#039;m no-one senior -- just an honorary research associate at Bristol -- but I do have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a fair bit of experience in publishing my work&lt;/a&gt;.

First up, you need to choose where to publish. At this point, if your work is any kind of science (you didn&#039;t say), the obvious choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plosone.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;. Why?

1. They publish your work open access, so anyone can read it.
2. Although they have quite high publication fees, they WILL waive those fees.
3. They have no limits on word-count, number of figures, etc., so you won&#039;t need to compress your work. Let it be its natural length.
4. It&#039;s now a well-respected journal. (For those who care, its impact factor is 4-point-something, which is better than the great majority of society journals.)
5. Its policy is to publish all submissions that are scientifically sound, without trying to guess at work&#039;s likely impact and cherry-picking only the sexiest.
6. It turns work around quickly -- typically within a couple of months, and with no &quot;in press&quot; period (which can be YEARS at some journals!)

Second choice at this point may be PeerJ, but it&#039;s very new and has yet to establish the reputation of PLOS ONE. For someone publishing for the first time, PLOS ONE&#039;s track-record makes it more appealing.

You&#039;ll need to look at the submission guidelines for your chosen journal (here are those for PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;), format your work accordingly, and then use the online submission system.

I&#039;m happy to take more detailed questions -- this is a very 30,000-feet overview. You can leave more comments here (I will see them) or if you prefer email me on .

One more important point to make: your manuscript is now a manuscript. The fact that it had a previous life as your masters thesis is no longer relevant. It gives you neither and advantage nor a disadvantage: from here on, your work stands on its own merit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have recently completed my MSc and have been looking at how and where I can publish my work. I used the internet to obtain my data through a questionnaire and have had quite a lot of interest in what my results found and if people can reference my research. For this reason and the fact that some of my results suggest differences compared to previous research in the area I am looking to publish, however I have no idea where to start. Any information from anyone who knows about this or has previously published work before would be appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the replies. Yes, I know that self-plagiarism is something real. And it is mentioned everywhere in plagiarism instructions. I think that I probably should mention somewhere in the end of article, that this work was based on my Masters dissertation.
Again, thanks for the replies. I did not know about FigShare.
And, very nice blog and very interesting this particular post about publishing masters&#039; works.]]></description>
