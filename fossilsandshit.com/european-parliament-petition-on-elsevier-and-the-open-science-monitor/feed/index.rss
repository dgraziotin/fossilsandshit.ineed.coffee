Thanks, Ronald! Yeah, a few people have mentioned this now - please accept my apologies. I have forwarded this to the Secretariat now, but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much that they can do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh. The EU site is clunky. First you have to register, then sign in, then search find the petition (keyword &quot;Science&quot; worked), then click &quot;support&quot; two times.. But I made it through the hoops!
Thanks for the immense effort to get this started.]]></description>

Hey Damien, thanks for these kind comments. I do think that Elsevier and the Lisbon Council have acted shamefully over this, and I also do not feel that the EC has the best interests of the wider public in mind over scientific matters. I honestly have no idea how it will end - I see a lot of angry people at Elsevier and their kin, but not many people doing anything about it. 
The PDF link is broken atm, but yes, I will add it when it&#039;s fixed, good idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I have just caught up on the events that followed the publication of the article in the Guardian (thanks for the summary at the beginning of the article).  It has become a textbook case on how to stifle opponents by discriminating against them, the balance of power between private and public and the functioning of our European democratic institutions... I wonder how this is all going to end.

Can I suggest that you add a direct link to the pdf of the petition in your article?

I wish I had half your talent and will. 
Thank you for the hard work done for the (often thankless) research community.]]></description>
