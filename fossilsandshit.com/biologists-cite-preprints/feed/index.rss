I think an opinion piece that carefully thinks through the issues and makes recommendations would be helpful. To reach the taxonomic community it would need to be published somewhere like Zootaxa. I could contribute to such an article but not lead it due to other time commitments.

This may also by the way be a legitimate reason for certain taxonomy-focused journals refusing to consider papers that have been posted as preprints. That appears to be the case for Zootaxa.]]></description>

Ah yeah, you&#039;re right of course. This is important, but I think the issue can be avoided by simply avoiding preprints with taxonomic content, or redacting it like we will do at paleorXiv. It&#039;s a shame biorXiv hasn&#039;t considered this angle, and I wonder why they haven&#039;t. The issue, as you outline, is quite clear to me (and I hope to others!), and either the paleorXiv or PeerJ preprint solution seems to resolve it nicely. Actually, I wonder then if it&#039;s worth assembling a few people together to write such an opinion piece for a taxonomy-focused journal?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As we&#039;ve discussed before, taxonomic preprints with new nomenclatural acts are potentially problematic due to the potential for conflicting versions of taxonomy in preprints versus postprints, and I would not cite them. 

The ICZN say &quot;posting electronic preprints is not good practice for nomenclatural works.&quot; Some preprint servers appear to agree. PeerJ Preprints say &quot;PeerJ Preprints should not be used to name or propose new nomenclatural acts (as per the policies which have been put in place by organizations such as the ICZN and ICN). Instead these articles should be submitted to the peer-reviewed PeerJ journal.&quot; Your own PaleorXiv has more relaxed draft guidelines, which focus on redacting taxonomic acts rather than not posting the preprint at all. 

By contrast, bioRxiv guidelines state nothing about taxonomy at all, and it is quite easy to find examples of new nomenclatural acts  published as preprints by searching for e.g. &quot;sp. nov.&quot; 

Surprisingly, this issue seems to have received little attention in the taxonomic community as far as I am aware - I have yet to track down any opinion pieces, commentaries, blog posts etc. dealing with it.]]></description>
