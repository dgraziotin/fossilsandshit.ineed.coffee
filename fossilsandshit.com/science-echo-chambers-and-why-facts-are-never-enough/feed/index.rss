					<description><![CDATA[&quot;What does the overwhelming majority of evidence say?&quot;

Unfortunately, there is no &quot;overwhelming majority of evidence&quot;. That is part of the problem. Of course people commonly take sides and argue that one line of evidence is more persuasive than another. Non-scientists might be surprised at how often subjective reasons eventually sway a scientist one way or the other. 

Sometimes both sides can be right for reasons that become apparent later, or both data sets fall within the same envelope of relatively large uncertainty that accompanies what are really quite small changes. These types of disagreements certainly occur with other, less politicized, scientific questions. They can rumble on for many decades until a &#039;rock-crushing&#039; piece of evidence appears, as it once did with continental-drift away from mid oceanic ridges before magnetic-anomaly measurements produce symmetrical &#039;bar-codes&#039; either side of the oceanic ridges.

 And sometimes the question itself may be &#039;incorrect&#039;. In this instance it can be, and is, argued that the surface thermometers are not actually measuring the same thing as the satellites, which measure temperatures up in the atmosphere (where, importantly, increased greenhouse gases should be expected to show their effect most noticeably). Radiosonde (balloon) measurements tend to agree with satellites, but the matter still appears unresolved.

Back on the main topic of the post, there is an interesting corollary/question to the striking figure shown from Kahan&#039;s article: Are people in the right hand side of the graphic likely to change their voting habits as a result of this politicization of a scientific issue? From a personal perspective I can give a very definite &quot;yes&quot;.]]></description>

*Bayesians.

If you want to do any sort of effective communication on this matter, using different acronyms isn&#039;t going to help, and nor is cherry picking examples. 

I want concrete evidence that there is large-scale ambiguity regarding the status of anthropogenic-induced dramatic global climatic disruption. What you provide, if this is true, is that there was a short warming phase within an otherwise longer phase of cooling based on one source of data, that a single different data source contradicts. Is that correct? What does the overwhelming majority of evidence say? That is the important thing, and what we should base our scientific evaluations on. The important next step is how do we communicate that consensus in an effective way to a range of audiences.]]></description>

The ambiguity allows different people to take different positions. The weight of evidence in complex cases is relative to the observer, because it depends on what one believes. Even the Baysians agree to this. 

If you want an example, the surface statistical models like HadCRU show sharp warming 1978-1997. This is the primary basis for AGW. But the UAH satellite measures show no such warming. Thus some people believe that the warming exists while others do not.]]></description>

Hello David,

It&#039;s nice to have your expert opinions here again, after those which you elucidated for us on our F1000 Research paper. Your comment, &quot;The debate exists because the science is ambiguous.&quot; is rather grand, as we might expect. Do you perhaps have any evidence to support this? It is, irrespective of this, at odds with your follow-on statement, &quot;Thus reasonable people can look at the evidence and come to opposite conclusions.&quot; - this has nothing to do with potentially conflicting evidence, but more bout how people choose to read evidence in different contexts.

&quot;I’d love to see more about the generation of the data, how calculations were done etc. for the climate change example. &quot;

      You know I spent 10 years begging for that and then actually doing it. 

      Guess what?

      1. People still refuse to look at the data.
      2. They still refuse to look at the code
      3. If you write in a language they dont like, they will attack the code, not the science.
      4. If you supply your code in SVN, they will demand Git
      5. If your website of data isnt organized or updated to their liking, they will call you a fraud
      6. If you post all your relevant data,  they will ask for even more, and criticize you for not being
           as fast as they think you should be.
      7. If you prepare special datasets for them ( cause they dont know what they are doing )  They will
           never publish or acknowledge your work.. basically they give you homework, and if you dont
           answer their questions in a timely fashion.. they accuse you of lying, being a fraud, stonewalling.


 So ya, back in 2007 ( go check)  I spent a bunch of time  demanding that climate scientists share their data and code. All that history played out in climategate ( yes, I&#039;m that steven Mosher) On the other side of climategate
There has been a change.. More data is available and code as well. I literally donated years of work to make the data and code more open. The naive belief was that once people could see and use the data and tools themselves that at least one small corner of the fight would get civilized and folks could reach agreement.

Boy was I wrong. The Opposite happened.]]></description>

Hi Larry

&quot; it’s that many people advocating public policy action to fight anthropogenic climate change prefer responding to strawman, rather than listen to and address skeptics’ objections.&quot;

Here is my experience in Listening to and addressing skeptics.

 For about 5 years (2007 -2012) I listened to skeptic issues with temperature series. I wrote code ( free of charge ) so they could do their own investigations. I looked at every one of their objections in detail.  In 2012
if joined a non profit to do the same thing I had been doing as a hobby. Answering the skeptical issues with the temperature series. We published papers, memos, data, code.. And we addressed every issue they raised. We even  used methods they suggested. Our top statistician spent time reading everything top
skeptic statisticians had written and we used the best ideas that skeptics had.

What has been the result?

from my perspective the insults have gotten worse. the claims of fraud have increased. 

basically the opposite of what you&#039;d expect.]]></description>

hwv,  You seem frustrated by the fact that a lot of people don&#039;t care that much about climate change and thus don&#039;t really care what experts say about it.  That is a fact of life and of the way human beings think and behave.  There are many many challenges faced by human civilization currently and in the past.  Trying to prioritize those challenges is a question to a large extent of values.  Science can only provide facts and can say nothing about people&#039;s values and priorities.  And an additional effect here is that the public has grown weary of all the &quot;crisis&quot; reporting and propaganda from advocacy organizations.  Some of it has even emanated from &quot;scientific consensus&quot; and the government, for example on the issue of dietary fat.  

It is a favored modern virtue signaling technique to become a public advocate for some cause you really really believe in.  Fear mongering often accompanies this virtue signaling and can seem to be required to get people to pay attention to how virtuous you are.  And hypocrisy of course merely further alienates the public.

But for those considering the virtue signaling profession, being respectful and polite is the best option.  Failure is guaranteed when you are a dick about its, as our gracious host says.]]></description>

Many viral posts these days pander to the crowd, and affirms a belief that their specific group is of special intelligence and insight. Furthermore, I&#039;d bet that an analysis of viral posts these days would likely find a strong element of condescension for the other side.  That said, do you think it would be possible to have a platform that reduces echo chambers?  I&#039;ve written about it on medium: https://medium.com/@the7th.us/make-it-stop-the-echo-is-killing-us-d7d35dff01dd#.g5fch5eu9
