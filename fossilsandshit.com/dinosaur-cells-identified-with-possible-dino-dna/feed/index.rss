I will stick with the &quot;they might get a chicken&quot; thing.  What&#039;s going to happen is they will end up creating something that reproduces quickly, grows to about 5 feet tall, is deadly, and doesn&#039;t like us.
Too many Sci-fy movies, I think.]]></description>

Ha! 

I think the idea is that you can reverse engineer a genome in early developmental stages to sort of craft the phenotype through ontogeny, by applying the right tweaks and the right chemicals at the right time. I think Jack Horner has a book on it!]]></description>

You would really think that any society with Godzilla in their past would shy away from dinosaur DNA testing.]]></description>
