Hi Aidan,

Thanks for your comment. I&#039;ll look into it a bit more, but a quick scan online shows that there are 13,000 wellbores in the Barnett Shale alone (Source: http://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?navid=2280&#038;pageid=5216)

I suspect actually this number refers specifically to the total number of individual &#039;fracs&#039;, but if that figure for the BS is true, then it can probably by extrapolated to the total shale in the US, and looks a little more reasonable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested how this claim can be supported : 
&quot;Furthermore, there are 183,000 wells that pre-date records in Pennsylvania&quot;
If the wells predate &quot;records&quot;, how does one even know of their existence?

I have a suspiscion that it&#039;s a &quot;pulled out of thin air&quot; number. (I&#039;ve seen it waved around elsewhere, so it&#039;s not you doing the air-pulling.) Drilling for hydrocarbons started in approximately 1860 (IIRC the Spindletop gusher was 1857), or 152 years. So that figure is asserting approximately 3 wells completed per day. In Pennsylvania alone. With a typical well taking around a month to drill, another month to complete (highly variable, of course ; and I mostly do offshore drilling which is typically deeper and more complicated than land drilling ; but that doesn&#039;t really affect the argument), then that would imply around 200 rigs working in Pennsylvania alone. Simultaneously. You&#039;d practically be able to see from one crown block to the next!
I suspect that the number is a guesstimate for the contiguous US as a whole. And three significant digits is being pretty optimistic for a guesstimate.

(I work in the oil industry ; I anticipate continuing employment from doing shale gas wells. But I also dislike seeing particularly dodgy figures being thrown around.)]]></description>

Cheers for your comments Michael - totally agree with all of them!

With respect to the issues in the US, these are things I guess the UK can learn from. They were mainly the result of poor management and regulation (or so I&#039;m told), so as long as we are rigorous in application of both, we can reduce leaking etc. - these aren&#039;t issues with fracking techniques per se, just humans being sloppy when it comes to doing their job. Hopefully we can learn from this.

Wrt emissions, this is more difficult. As a geologist, I don&#039;t feel it is my position to offer an opinion on this, but I do recognise the utmost importance of understanding the impact on global warming. My hope is that shale gas simply acts as a temporal buffer to kick-start R&#038;D with green technologies, as currently we&#039;ve taken a step back wrt proposed targets, in all aspects.

I&#039;d recommend  following the above link today, as the shale gas meeting (all strictly about the geoscience) is commencing shortly! (GMT)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for the summary. I think you give a fair summary of the situation but I think there are two additional points. THey concern the effect of Shale Gas on the price of gas and fuel/electricity in general, and the GW impact. In reverse order.

If we could use shale gas to quickly replace coal for electricity generation we would reduce emissions associated with electricity production from coal. However, studies in the US have shown that major shale gas fields leak methane in amounts which essentially cancel the benefit of switching to methane over coal. More details here and in links from the article.

http://protonsforbreakfast.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/could-fracking-be-our-least-worst-option/

Whether or not shale gas affects emissions significantly, it will presumably affect the price. If it lowers the price of energy significantly then - welcome as that is - it will make investment in really sustainable energy solutions appear even less economic than it currently is.

So for me the pros and cons of fracking depend on the global warming impact. If it is done in a regulated manner then it could help - if it runs out of control it will only make matters worse.

All the best

Cheers dude!

If you want to help educate people, there&#039;s a Shale Gas Briefing being held at the Geological Society of London on Monday 18. It&#039;s going to be webcast live here: http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/shalegas - the link should become active later on today.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great synopsis of Davies&#039; talk!  This is a rather interesting topic for me, as I live near the edges of the Utica Shale play in Ohio...so &quot;fracking&quot; is in the news almost every day.  It seems to be a constant battle to educate friends and family on the topic: the news may not always be accurate, but they&#039;re apparently more entertaining than my explanations.  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
