					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/an-open-analogy/#comment-239&quot;&gt;netgull&lt;/a&gt;.

I guess that&#039;s the weakness of the analogy - ultimately, scientists/researchers have a moral obligation to convey knowledge to the public. That&#039;s why we do it, right? Progression and communication of science! But the Army is under no such obligation, and in fact relies on secrecy to some degree. So yeah, that&#039;s where the analogy breaks down in terms of output, but I still think that the processes are somewhat comparable.

Theoretically open, yes! But if it takes 6-12 months for a &#039;formal&#039; response, that&#039;s pretty inefficient. In no other domain is communication so slow due to unnecessary restrictions (this is why things like PLoS&#039; open comments sections is awesome!). Obviously me agree totes with all of last paragraph - I understand that money has to be spent in publication models, I just think atm it&#039;s totally wrong. There are plenty of articles out there which describe the issues much better than I ever could :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As much as I like analogies, I find it a bit ironic that you use the army, one of the organisations that arguably has a lot to benefit from keeping information and knowledge secret from the public, to advocate an open access model. The system is fast, because it is to a great degree hierarchical: the decision of the superior is final and I would imagine rarely open to criticism. Are these bad qualities? Not necessarily. The purpose of the system is not to generate knowledge for humanity, but to work fast and efficiently if it is required to act.

I cannot think of any other system in place where information and knowledge is being subjected to such a rigorous review and discussion, that is theoretically open (in that anyone can publish a response?) and occurs between equals. Open access and post-publication online and open review will surely improve the system heaps, but maximizing efficiency cannot be the main goal, unless people are specifically paid to write, publish and review scientific information.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Liking what I&#039;m reading so far... 

just an edit as I go:

&quot;typically taking an average of 12 months &quot;

you&#039;ll find in other disciplines the turnaround is a lot quicker than that. I&#039;d make an edit to &#039;correct&#039; that to make it clear you&#039;re talking about Palaeontology journals (I presume)]]></description>
