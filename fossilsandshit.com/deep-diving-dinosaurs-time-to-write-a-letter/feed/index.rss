XKCD is pretty good fun. Puts things in perspective. I wish they&#039;d mentioned that the two boreholes they mention took rather different times to drill : the Macondo well (&quot;Deepwater Horizons&quot; on the drawing) took about a year to drill ; the Kola superdeep borehole was started in about 1978, and drilling operations stopped around about 1990. That&#039;s largely because the Russians had to develop a variety of technologies that TransOcean (owners and operators of the DWH, and in particular, the BOP that didn&#039;t P the BO) and BP (designers of the well but not owners of the equipment used) effectively could go and pick up off the shelf.
Yeah, you can tell which part of industry I work in, can&#039;t you?]]></description>

Searching on (as New Scientist&#039;s &#039;Feedback&#039; would put it) A Famous Search Engine for &quot;emperor penguin diving depth&quot; revealed a rich seam of research work that has already been done, and the fact that people at Swansea University (surprise?) and the British Antarctic Survey (!surprise) have published on the matter. Ohhh, shiny Open Access papers ; goody! But I&#039;ve a Schiehallion to climb today, so I doubt I&#039;ll be seeing many diving penguins there.
I wonder what the Gaelic for &quot;penguin&quot; is?]]></description>
