					<description><![CDATA[Maxwell (2012) uses morphometric (although not geometric) analyses to quantify variation among a variety of elements (skull, vertebrae, appendicular elements) in a broad selection of specimens from the Posidonia Shale that have been referred to &lt;i&gt;Stenopterygius&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hauffiopteryx&lt;/i&gt;, finding four discreet groups, including neonates through adults. She affirms synonymy of several specimens into four species: &lt;i&gt;tricissus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;quadricissus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;uniter&lt;/i&gt;, in &lt;i&gt;Stenopterygius&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;typicus&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Hauffiopteryx&lt;/i&gt;. I wonder why papers that assess quanitiative measures against systematic results receive less attention than systematic results alone, but oh well.

I like that. So, what is and isn&#039;t a species is dependent on the point in time. Meaning that species are useful in [neontological] ecology (and conservation efforts) but virtually useless in paleontology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely agree about this sudden burst of &quot;fill-in-blank-here level of taxa&quot; studies in recent years: like a flashback to the 1970s and &#039;80s!

Over the last few years I&#039;ve actually become very partial to Darwin&#039;s (often forgotten) species concept: that species were no more or less than well-differentiated varieties distinguished only by the extinction of the gradations intermediate with their closest relatives. (The oft-repeated trope that &quot;Darwin didn&#039;t talk about the origin of species in the &lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;&quot; is hogwash; what people really mean is &quot;Darwin didn&#039;t talk about the origin of Mayrian species in the &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/what-is-a-fossil-species/#comment-169&quot;&gt;James Lamsdell&lt;/a&gt;.

Glad you said that! I hated all these &#039;high-impact&#039; articles of the last few months talking about a &#039;burst of family-level diversity&#039; or whatever nonsense..

How is a species a real biological unit though? I mean, you&#039;ve done loads wrt eurypterids right? How do you rigorously diagnose one species from another..?

Cheers for the book tip! Any chance you know a link where there&#039;s a free pdf..? *empty wallet*]]></description>
