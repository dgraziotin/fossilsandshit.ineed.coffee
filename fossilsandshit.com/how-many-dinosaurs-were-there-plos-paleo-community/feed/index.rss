Further complicating issue is that except for mass mortalities, even if you have two very similar specimens of a (morpho-)species, they’re almost certainly separated in time by many generations. So the question of interbreeding ability is really quite fraught. The complication of (possible) sexual dimorphism in the adults, and correctly assigning juvenile skeletons to adult (morpho-)species is just another issue.
My guess would be that we’re missing a lot of variability in species because we don’t have (much) of the feathers and other surface features, which were probably important for mating cues. But it’s still a guess.

This is a great point! The mating ability theory is known as the biological species concept. It&#039;s a bit difficult to measure in fossil species for obvious reasons - you can&#039;t measure reproductive isolation in the fossil record. In the fossil record there is a quite subjective method applied called the morphospecies concept. How the two relate is still open for research!]]></description>
