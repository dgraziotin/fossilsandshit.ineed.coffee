					<description><![CDATA[I have lost many harddrives in the last 15 years.  Any attempt to put OA into practice can not rely on personal harddrives or individual long-term personal data management.

But it doesn&#039;t help with the vast majority of research that was published in the past.]]></description>

Awareness is one of the things we can do to help reduce inertia. The tech exists, although if you&#039;ve lost a hard-drive then there&#039;s probably more than just tech issues..!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well not so sure. Awareness is important, but then there is also inertia. I got the idea because I wanted to do exactly this with my meagre collection of papers. And the manuscripts surely are on a personal harddrive. Or maybe not. Doesn&#039;t matter, I have no idea where that harddrive from 2002 is now, anyway. I believe a little tech can help a lot to turn awareness into action.]]></description>

Yes, I agree. This flow chart does not capture the whole diversity of possible approaches.  But it does make a good guide for many cases.

And yes, agree that there is still the issue with historical content. The thing is, most researchers will have the pre-post print versions of manuscripts already on their hard-drives. You can probably skip steps 1-3 at a personal level. I&#039;ve seen many researchers recently doing this, and it&#039;s great! It can be difficult, especially for pre-digital papers, but is definitely possible on a massive scale. The tools and platforms exist, it&#039;s the awareness that is often lacking, I feel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is difficult indeed to capture a cross product of all the options with individual preferences in a flow-chart.
Something slightly different:
Too little attention is given to older articles that could be freed automatically. I want someone to program this:

1. Researcher identifies itself, gets a list of all papers she published with Elsevier (because they have a common policy across journals and megagiga marketshare).
2. All papers are downloaded (assume institutional access).
3. The PDFs are stripped of the Elsevier layout, fonts, logo, etc (I guess that is the hard part), so that they are indistinguishable from an &quot;author manuscript&quot;.
4. The proper license is slapped on ( CC-BY-NC-ND as mandated by Elsevier)
5. Everything is uploaded to institutional repository (if that is well-indexed) or any other non-commercial one and the appropriate embargo is set.

I guess that would make quite an impact and be completely legal at the same time.

Hey Elsevier, I know you are reading this blog, that&#039;s OK with you?]]></description>

Hey Harald,

Well, this is a very good question. and one only individual researchers can answer. Some want the glory, some want the OA at point of publishing, some don&#039;t like green OA, some journals are gold OA only. There are a variety of potential reasons.

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the flow-chart, good job. But what is the rationale to spend money on gold OA over green OA? Also, it could be argued that &quot;choose a different journal&quot; should be already the reaction to &quot;Can&#039;t publish a post-print&quot;.]]></description>
