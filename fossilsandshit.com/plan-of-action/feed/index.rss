Hey, this is a great idea! I&#039;ll be adding a glossary of all jargony words used now - thanks for the idea! (*figures out if I can acknowledge kindredsprit23 in thesis*) ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two things, neither of which may have a whit to do with anything:
First, the single ellipses around event at the beginning.  I tend to use them also and have been told not to.  I was told, basically, that if I wrote correctly, the emphasis would not be necessary.
Second, are you allowed to put a basic glossary of some of the elementary words such as &quot;tetrapod&quot;?  I can infer the basic meaning from the word itself, but it would be nice to have just some of them defined for ease of reading.  I am sure the readers of your paper do not need such aides.
Just a couple of thoughts - well written!
