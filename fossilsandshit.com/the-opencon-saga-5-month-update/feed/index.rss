					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/the-opencon-saga-5-month-update/#comment-7659&quot;&gt;Samir Hachani&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for your kind and wise words, Samir. I wish I could get on with my life, but the damage that OpenCon has caused has been quite severe. I never asked for much in my life, and took little for myself, and have been left with even less now. It will be difficult to sustain myself in the future with this still hanging over my head. Either OpenCon can apologise, which they won&#039;t, or I can take legal action, which I have no real wish for. I do believe that justice finds us all eventually in one way or another though. For now, I want this resolved and out of my mind so I can move on. But it bugs me that people are going to seemingly get away with things. It will pass :)]]></description>
