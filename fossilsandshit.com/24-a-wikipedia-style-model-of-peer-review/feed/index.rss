Wikipedia *discourages* citing primary literature. If there is secondary literature, a text which interprets the primary literature, that takes precedent. Just wanted to say the culture, system and aims are quite different.

Wikipedia also does not reward expertise. So a scientist with citations to the scientific literature (primary literature) can be overruled in the discussions on the talk page by amateurs providing links to tabloid newspapers (secondary literature). Climate &quot;sceptics&quot; hate the Wikipedia pages on climate because it will not publish their nonsense as science, but also climate scientists can be frustrated by the system.

Thanks for the comment, Victor! Yes, you&#039;re right, it&#039;s more a form of peer-to-peer review, but ultimately the key goal is the same (content improvement). I think you&#039;re only half right with the original research thing though, as now there are Wiki-journals! And I don&#039;t think it forbids citing the primary literature, and indeed there are efforts to increase the coverage of citations here, and particularly for OA articles. You can see that displayed now on pages, I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is called peer review in Wikipedia is more calling on (outsiders) for ideas on how to improve an article. I only tried once to get a &quot;peer review&quot;, got one review after several months. It has little to do with peer review as we practise it in science.

The peer review that makes Wikipedia articles high quality is inherent in the system where everyone can make and suggest edits and talk about necessary changes in case there are disagreements.

Wikipedia explicitly forbids doing original research. It is only interested in settled knowledge. It also discourages citing the primary literature, like we would do, and prefers secondary literature. Wikipedia articles are only writing for topics with sufficient notability. This to limit the number of articles and increase the number of people reading and editing and debating problem with the articles that are published.

To make this work for original research, by scholars who need credit (in the current fake competitive system), about topics where often only a few people in the world can participate, will be a challenge and likely such a large change that it will be hard to recognize the origins.]]></description>
