					<description><![CDATA[Ah, the joys of seeing it in real life.
As a mantle petrologist and igneous petrogenesis-ist by training, I tried ploughing my way through Lynn Margulis&#039; (and A.N.Other) &quot;Five Kingdoms&quot; as a &quot;rampage through the phyla, making notes as I went on.
I got as far as phylum 40-odd, in the Animal Kingdom, before conceding defeat when I noticed that the second edition was out, revising about a half-dozen phyla. Will someone please nail the squishy things down!]]></description>
