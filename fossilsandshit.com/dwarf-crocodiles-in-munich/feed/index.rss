					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/dwarf-crocodiles-in-munich/#comment-400&quot;&gt;protohedgehog&lt;/a&gt;.

Studied ... well, I grew up on the Upper Estuarine and Northampton Sands of central England, which are approximate contemporaries, but apart from getting into geology because of them (and Scottish mountains), I&#039;ve never really studied them. I make my living largely on late Jurassic clastics of the North Sea, or more precisely on the hydrocarbons in their pore spaces. But that&#039;s more to do with understanding drilling technology than detailed geological work.
I was in Solenhofen because I&#039;d booked leave for the 1999 eclipse in 1991, but my friend who I was going to go touring with blew up the engine of his car 3 days before we were due to leave. So ... tent ; rucksack ; InterRail card ; and after the eclipse I went to various geological wet dreams, including Solenhofen and the Nordlingen Ries crater.
It beats working for a living.]]></description>

Correct! This one is from Solnhofen, and there are other specimens from the similar limestones in Cerin, France, which I&#039;m hoping to go and check out shortly (grant application submitted!) These limestones are actually found in Spain too, and combined with France and Bavaria, that&#039;s where you find Atoposaurus, Alligatorellus, Alligatorium, and Montsecouschus specimens. Strangely, Theriosuchus, the most diverse genus, is found in different rock types from around Europe and in much higher abundance (as well as Thailand..)

Have you studied these rocks before then..?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From the colour and texture, that looks like the Solenhofen Lithographic limestone your beastie is in? (Which, TBH, is what I suspected you&#039;d be doing, if you were looking at JU rocks in southern Germany. I certainly did. I didn&#039;t find *my* Archaeopteryx specimen either. Boo!)]]></description>
