In most cases, it was just the way the journal ran. A couple of journals had their costs picked up by the scientific society that ran them (e.g., Knowledge and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems, Crustacean Research). Some were very small niche journals (Invertebrate Rearing, Global Virtue Ethics Review). One, as mentioned in post, was an introductory offer.

In no cases did I write and ask for a waiver.]]></description>

In general, 70% of &#039;gold&#039; OA journals do not even charge any APCs... Varies from field to field and of course journal reputation (whenever that matters).]]></description>

Liz,

I am 100% unfunded, and I have yet to pay an APC. I think nearly every OA journal editor is aware of the financial issues different people face, and the great majority will be sympathetic to a simple request to waive the APC. There is certainly no downside in asking!]]></description>

For the journals that did not charge you APCs, do they have fee waivers available that you can apply for? Or did you just write to them and ask? I know of at least 2 journals that are new and currently waiving their APC, which I am planning on submitting at least one paper to ASAP. Unfortunately, these &quot;limited time only&quot; offers are not always well timed for when I have a paper ready to submit. 

Definitely some of what you said isn&#039;t possible for me, but it&#039;s interesting to see some other ways you&#039;ve managed. I wish that more OA journals (or journals that offered OA) would offer fee waivers if you could show that you don&#039;t have funding. Not only am I not RCUK funded, but I&#039;m not even fully funded, so paying OA out of pocket is hard.]]></description>

It will be CC-BY when it has been published. The article is being typeset now, and as soon as it&#039;s published, the embargo will drop for my IR, and I&#039;ll also upload the final version there too. At the moment, it&#039;s just the accepted manuscript in the IR.

I have no idea what the policies are regarding VAT, but all I know is that I&#039;ve (my funder) been paying it!]]></description>

You are correct about causation, of course. However, see this case study for an example of how virtually all decisions about people (tenure, promotion hiring) are made these days (with direct reference to Mike):

The one mitigating factor worth mentioning here is while this study does a good job of showing correlation between high-IF publications and &quot;success&quot; (i.e. becoming a PI), it says nothing about causation. Mike Eisen has argued that people whose work ends up in high-IF journals may do so because it&#039;s good work, and the goodness of the work is also the reason they get PI jobs. If he&#039;s right, then the two correlated measures are both dependent on the third. (I don&#039;t know how to test that possibility, though -- does anyone see a way?)

BTW., the article itself is a fine advert for what a completely craptastic process glam-mag publishing is. The whole thing is compressed nearly to the point of unreadability, key information is relegated to the SI, and the single figure is in fact eight or at most five quite separate figures wedged together in super-tiny size to fit some arbitrary and pointless limit imposed by Cell. The authors work would have been far more clear, persuasive and useful if they&#039;d published it at its natural length in a proper journal.]]></description>
