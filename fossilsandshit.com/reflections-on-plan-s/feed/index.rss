Thanks, Toma! Wanted to try and write something that hadn&#039;t been done yet, and that hopefully others will find useful in understanding more of the debate. I expect the future to be just as interesting/complex too :)]]></description>

Hmmh. I think you may need to finesse this a bit more for the point to come across, the end sounds like you are only blaming the backers for vested interests. And perhaps the response to PNAS by Kiley and Smits is at least partly in line with what you are calling for:

Firstly, thank you for reading to the end, Toma! Much appreciated.

I do mean those who back it, so Science Europe, RJS et al. For example, are they going to continue to let private interests erode scholarship and suck money from the public purse? Or will they simply say enough is enough, and they are going to invest in a non-profit scholarly infrastructure. I don&#039;t expect them to clearly answer this, but actions speak louder than words :)]]></description>
