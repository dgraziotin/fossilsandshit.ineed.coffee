Hi Herman,

The fossil depictions seem accurate to me. The total environmental restoration will always be a little leap of faith, as the fossil record only preserves scraps that hint at the bigger picture. I don&#039;t know about Steve Kirk&#039;s work, but I&#039;d imagine that anything from 1996 would be considered a bit out of date by palaeo-standards, given the number of findings from the Triassic in recent years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Cool restoration of a Triassic ecosystem, where dinosaurs were only just starting out&quot;

I have a question about that: Would you consider that &#038; Steve Kirk&#039;s other restorations as accurate for the time (1996)? I ask b/c I&#039;m reading a book w/several of them, but wasn&#039;t sure. Many thanks in advance.]]></description>
