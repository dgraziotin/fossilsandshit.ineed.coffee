Nice rant.

Although I&#039;m not of the generation you think - £40k of student debts says otherwise, along with a maxed out overdraft. Fortunately, my boss pays me an adequate wage for doing what I do, and I&#039;m highly thankful to him, as an intern.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the utterly disgusting behaviour of multi-generation silver-spooners and first-generation stainless-steel-spooners studiously pulling the ladder up behind themselves after the first generation of people have benefited from state-funded university-level education. 
The 1970s generation of studens had, in large part, parents with tin-plate spoons in their mouths ; they have done relatively well (thanks in large part to the investment in their education by the state), and now have stainless-steel teaspoons for theiir offspring. But now they have something to protect against the &quot;great unwashed&quot;, they are systematically cooperating with &quot;old money&quot; to stop more people from challenging them for their positions of power.
Scum-bags, the rancid lot of them. 
Quite likely both you and I are member of that relatively priviledged generation - I was the first person in my family (to any degree of relationship that we can trace) ever to go to university, and I was also in the last few years to recieve a student grant rather than a loan. Thanks to the support of my parents and the state in approximately equal measure, I&#039;m well up on the ladder from which one of my siblings has firmly fallen, while the other sibling is having some struggle to keep a hold onto.
But our political (and business, and legal ; all interchangeable) Lords and Masters have plainly decided that such social mobility (I don&#039;t consider it a climb, considering how many thorough-going bastards there are in the &quot;upper classes&quot; of British society) is insupportable now that they have benefited, and this is part of their technique of getting the boot firmly back onto the face of the masses. (Yes, that is a &#039;1984&#039; reference.)
(Rant ; fume, mutter. I&#039;ll get my bottle of Strong Cidre and go and sit on the town hall steps now, shouting at the seagulls.)]]></description>

I wouldn&#039;t be suprised to find that they will actually not hire anyone who doesn&#039;t have exact relevant previous experience - even for this amount of &#039;pay&#039;. Something I am coming across regularly as a job hunter is the fact that even for entry level positions that say you don&#039;t require previous experience in the role but, surprise surprise, they won&#039;t interview you if you don&#039;t have the so-called &#039;non-essential&#039; experience!
