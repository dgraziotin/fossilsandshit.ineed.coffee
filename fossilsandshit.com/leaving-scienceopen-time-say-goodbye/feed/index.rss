					<description><![CDATA[I am since mid 2015 trying to retract a fraudulent study on the breeding biology of the Basra Reed Warbler in a Taylor &#038; Francis journal (open access, see below for details), and I would like to tell the readers of this blog that there are several similarities between experiences of Jon with dealing with open access advocates and my experiences with contacting open access advocates about my efforts to retract this fraudulent study.

I have for example already received several threats and I have also experienced badmouthing about me by a high-profile researcher, and behind my back. Jon states for example &quot;there is an incredibly powerful, entrenched status quo in academia and publishing, and they do not like to be challenged&quot;. My experiences with several open access advocates are fully in line with this quote. To put in on other words: these open access advocates do not tolerate that they get challenged. 

I have experienced that these open access advocates are willing to go out of their league to prevent to start with a scientific dialogue / debate about any of the findings of the report &quot;Final investigation on serious allegations of fabricated and/or falsified data in Al-Sheikhly et al. (2013, 2015)&quot; (see below for details and access). Such an acting, so &#039;no response&#039;, and &#039;no response&#039;, and &#039;no response&#039;, etc., was not part of my academic education at RUG (University of Groningen, The Netherlands). Recent experiences have revealed that such an acting of these open access advocates ( so &#039;no response&#039; etc.) is still not part of the current day acting / behaviour of the people in my field of research (animal ecology, etc.).

The list with take homes is very valuable. I would like to add one item. 

Publish articles in peer-reviewed journals about events / experiences when dealing with the above listed issues with open access advocates. I have for example recently published an article about such an event in the open access journal &quot;Roars Transactions, a Journal on Research Policy and Evaluation&quot; ( https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/roars/article/view/9073 ).
