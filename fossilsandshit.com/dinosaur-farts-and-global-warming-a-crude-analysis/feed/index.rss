					<description><![CDATA[I have found something in complete contradiction of this. From the Triassic period until the Cretaceous, the oxygen in the atmosphere increased. 

Triassic = 16% (80% of modern level)
Jurassic = 26% (130% of modern level)
Cretaceous = 30% (150% of modern level)

					<description><![CDATA[...you&#039;re completely right. I took a look at this, and as a Paleoclimatologist, I was baffled at these assumptions. It didn&#039;t work for the Pleistocene, in which we have plentiful proxies, so why should one be convinced by a purely (flawed) mathematical modeling approach? Just a bunch of arm-waving, here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that is one serious bitchslapping, Jon!

I agree; this is literally a back of the envelope calculation that would be more at home if it was featured as a fun side thing, like in the New Scientist&#039;s last word column or something. Utterly pointless trying to put a concrete figure on something that nebulous, with so many variables and things we don&#039;t know.]]></description>
