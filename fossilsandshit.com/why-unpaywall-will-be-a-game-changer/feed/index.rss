Hi Glen,

So Google Scholar also indexes a lot of content that has been uploaded in breach of copyright (eg via ResearchGate). Unpaywall explicitly finds legal version of self-archived articles, thereby providing access in a sustainable way that encourages research communities to legally commit to Open Access. I don&#039;t think anyone has done a direct comparison yet between Google Scholar and Unpaywall in terms of &#039;green OA discoveribility&#039;, but that would be interesting. 

As someone without the privilege of institutional access, Google Scholar is much less useful to me now, as although it is great for discovering articles, it is much less useful for discovering ones without paywalls! 

Cheers,

Jon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I added unpaywall but have not found a single example where it found a paper that Google Scholar did not. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;d rather not rely on Google but have always done so, and wanted to test it out to see if it was somehow more powerful. I have not paid much attention to the other direction--that is when Google Scholar finds an article, does unpaywall ever miss it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article.  Unpaywall is important.  We&#039;ve been building a tool to &quot;unpaywall&quot; paywalled citations on Wikipedia by adding marked free-to-read versions alongside closed citations.  There is a lot we can&#039;t get without academia.edu and researchgate, but they pose both ethical and copyright compliance issues.  With Unpaywall it&#039;s less of a concern since it&#039;s just a utility, but with our tool OAbot (developed by/with Antonin Delpeuch of Dissem.in), the impact would be visible and concrete in the placement of a valuable link on and from Wikipedia.  What do you think.  Should OAbot give a &quot;scholarly network&quot; option like Unpwayall, or not go there at all?]]></description>
