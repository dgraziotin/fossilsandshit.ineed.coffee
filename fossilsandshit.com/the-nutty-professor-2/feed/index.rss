					<description><![CDATA[If you really want to understand Nutt&#039;s motives I suggest you read his editorial in the Journal of Pschopharmacolgy 2006 (Editor D Nutt) where he postulates a social replacement for alcohol. (Possibly based on benzos?) Alongside that, the article by Robin Room in the same journal suggesting (in terms) that inventing the substancve was not the problem, it was the lack of an integrated system of classification.

At the time Nutt held substantial financial holding (s?) in one or more pharamaceutical companies.

I have heard Nutt speak, more than once. He misrepresents the debate around cannabis classification. When challenged, he burbles and is lost.

Put alongside that Nutt&#039;s own confession to illegal drug use (not cannabis he says).

The &quot;Delphic Analysis&quot; he used for his integrated scale of harms, is not scientific as you have correctly identified. His partner Colin Blakemore has been an advocate for more toleration of drugs, especially cannabis.]]></description>

(Hope you take that the right way, Jon! Don&#039;t know why wordpress don&#039;t allow comment embedding)

I&#039;m not going to read the paper. But I think all Nutt is trying to do is make a gallant attempt to quantify harm. Harm is so subjective, so yes, it&#039;s going to be flimsy and based on many assumptions. How the hell else can you grade harm but in this way? I mean, heroin is a completely different form of harm to alcohol. You could argue that alcohol is significantly more harmful because you&#039;re more likely to smack some derp who gets in your way rather than ignore them.

I&#039;m no Nutt evangelist, but I still can&#039;t see any other sensible way of grading it apart from taking into account all these factors.]]></description>
