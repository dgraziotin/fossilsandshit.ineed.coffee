					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/what-academic-mobbing-feels-like/#comment-6321&quot;&gt;Oisin&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Oisin, thanks for taking the time to comment, I do appreciate it. The posts I have been making on all of this have been getting an incredible amount of traffic, and yet virtually no engagements compared to what I usually post. The inverse pattern. 

It does feel like pretty much everything I stand for, have worked for, and all of the things I have achieved have been taken away now. Part of me thinks that this was the intention too, and I am still waiting to be shown otherwise. If I was really some sort of high-risk menace, I would be the first to remove myself from social situations. I did forgive myself a long time ago for this little thing, as did the other person involved. The injustice just keeps rearing its ugly head and dragging on though. I really do not want to sue anyone, but as for recovering from the damages done and seeking at least one form of justice, I do feel I am being left with little choice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a random stranger who found this post as my first exposure to this incident. I&#039;m appalled at how you have been treated.

For many who follow incidents like this, the flurry of injustice after injustice is deeply depressing. I was tempted not to comment, but I was conscious of being another ambiguous page view to be interpreted as passive judgement of your character.

Even if we take these allegations as totally and unambiguously true (which I don&#039;t), mistakes are human. Your character is not defined by a moment in time, a minor social infraction that happened years before.

The reality is that this is trendy at the moment. It&#039;s fun for people to attack strangers for imagined crimes. Simple as this.

The reality is that the benefits you bring to the people closest to you, and the positive influence you could have in academia, have been stolen. The wider community has lost you, and that is a minor tragedy.

The reality is that you deserve the chance to move on from this. My ideal would be to see you sue your primary interlocutors for defamation. I can understand how you would not want to do this, how it would prolong your exposure to more toxicity and pain. I&#039;d just love to see justice done, and your name cleared.

I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive yourself. I hope you find peace.]]></description>

Thank you for your kind and thoughtful comment, Elizabeth. It certainly helps me to feel less alone in all of this. For me, it is quite heartbreaking, as I invested a lot of time and energy in this community, and the vast majority of them are wonderful people. I remain at a loss for how things escalated to such a state.

I still wish that justice will find its course, one way or another, in this. This includes if there is more that I am legitimately &#039;guilty&#039; of. And that there remain lessons for us all to learn from and grow stronger together with.

Thanks for the book recommendation, you are certainly not the first to suggest it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The online bullying you have experienced by OpenCon members and &#039;the mob&#039; is quite clear and public. Well done for keeping your cool and sticking to the facts.

If you had any kind of criminal case to answer then your accusers should follow up with the police, allow the law to take it&#039;s course and let justice prevail. However, this doesn&#039;t appear to resemble the reality of the situation.

OpenCon appear to have fostered a pretty toxic community culture that first encourages, and then protects, salacious and malicious gossip spread by its members. 

Without irony, this is referred to as a &#039;whisper network&#039; by OpenCon members on twitter.

No mistake, this is frenzied and thoughtless psychological bullying. I&#039;m certain that there will be many who think as I do, that there is great shame in the behaviors exhibited by certain OpenCon members online. That the tearing down of a persons life and reputation without evidence is wrong. We may be less vocal than the mob, and we are all too often drowned out, or scared into silence/anonymity, or fatigued. But we exist.

The hypocrisy in OpenCon&#039;s handling and management of it&#039;s members speaks volumes. Thank you for bringing attention to these issues and best of luck.

OpenConned... laughable.

I strongly recommend you read Jon Ronson&#039;s work, e.g. his book &#039;So, you&#039;ve been publicly shamed&#039;. It seems highly relevant to your situation.]]></description>
