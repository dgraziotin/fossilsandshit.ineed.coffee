Was that program The Matrix by any chance..?

Remember that Walking with Dinosaurs actually had palaeontologists as consultants! Neck posture in sauropods is still something that&#039;s being hotly debated (see here: http://svpow.wordpress.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-hone-wedel-and-naish-2011-on-sexual-selection-of-sauropod-necks/)

Yeah, computers are great! There&#039;s plenty out there on digital palaeontology. It&#039;s not just palaeo though - we need computers to visualise DNA, model the mechanics of structures etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. Although, as a major Walking with Dinosaurs fan, I couldn&#039;t help but keep in the back of my mind something they said in the Making Of, which was that before they made the series, the didn&#039;t know about the correct neck posture, until it showed up on the digital construction.

They said that Walking with Dinosaurs discovered that, and were the ones who originally opened palaeontologists to digital constructions as a way of discovering more about dinosaurs than the palaeontologists already knew.

Also, I think it&#039;s funny that computers can figure out what we can&#039;t, and we have to rely on them to see it. I keep thinking of a program I once saw about how robots could inherit the earth. :P Silly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The BMNH isn&#039;t in Pennsylvania. That&#039;s a shot of Dippy as it used to be displayed in the old Reptile Gallery.

Interesting that Hutchinson also argued for the sprawling gait proposed by Hay and supported by Tornier. William Holland was pretty scathing about the idea- also noting that &lt;i&gt;Diplodocus&lt;/i&gt; would need a trench to walk around in.]]></description>

That&#039;s a pity - so much for reproducibility as a cornerstone of scientific research. I&#039;ll look his work up though - thanks for the tip off!
 
I&#039;m a bit out of the sauropod research, but has anyone considered doing musculoskeletal modelling like how Karl, Suzie, Vivian and Paul have just done for Lesothosaurus (and earlier in Poposaurus), just on necks and tails instead?]]></description>

No problem at all.

To give credit where it&#039;s due, Kent Stevens has done way more work on modelling sauropod posture than I (or my co-authors) have done.  All we did was look at extant animal behaviour and EPB that back onto sauropods.  Kent has built a pretty awesome system for modelling posture.  The problems are (A) that he uses some very dodgy assumptions in his models, and (B) no-one else has that software, so his work can&#039;t be reproduced and refined elsewhere.]]></description>

Thanks for the comments Mike!

Oops, sorry for the misquote then. I just used them as an example to show how far modelling has come in the light of new technology, admittedly after a not-too-thorough scan of the literature. I&#039;ll edit the article :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the all the shout-outs!  Just two things to comment on, one trivial the other not.

First: the correct generic name for the Tendaguru brachiosaurid that everyone thinks about when they hear the name &quot;&lt;i&gt;Brachiosaurus&lt;/i&gt;&quot; is now &lt;i&gt;Giraffatitan&lt;/i&gt;, unfortunately (Taylor 2009).  The link that Marc Vincent gave above (the second one!) will explain why.  But when we submitted our neck-posture paper (Taylor et al. 2009), and indeed when it was published, that study had not made it out into the world, so we didn&#039;t want to use the corrected name prematurely.  All my subsequent papers have used the name &lt;i&gt;Giraffatitan&lt;/i&gt;.

Second, and more important: note that the brachiosaur poses shown in the figure from our 2009 paper &lt;b&gt;do not show what we claim to be actual life poses&lt;/b&gt;.  They show only that the Steven and Parrish sub-horizontal neck notion is flawed by demonstrating how much ventral deflection from S&#038;P&#039;s claimed &quot;neutral pose&quot; would be necessary in order to drink, and what effect the same amount of dorsal deflection would have on posture.  They&#039;re &quot;what if&quot;s, not &quot;this is&quot;ses.]]></description>
