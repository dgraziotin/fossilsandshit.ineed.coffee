Jon,  Thanks very much.
It is a difficult time period, with closing seaways, isolated basins, endemic invertebrates, discontinuous sedimentation and missing intervals on the continents.  &#039;Transition&#039; maybe helps.  It is really a solid line drawn on the chronostratigraphic chart, as all stage boundaries are.   Part of the problem with vertebrates (land or marine) between the Jurassic and Cretaceous is data, or the lack of it.  One sees publications talking about evolutionary happenings at the boundary or across the boundary, when most of the fossil evidence actually comes from some way down in the Jurassic or well up into the Cretaceous - nowhere near the boundary.  There are not so many places where non-marine rocks from Tithonian/Berriasian times survive -  the Purbeck Formation of England is such a rarity - and deeper-water marine sequences seldom have vertebrates.  There is much research in progress on the calibration between non-marine (Purbeck) and (more numerous) marine sequences using magnetostratigraphy.  And, no doubt, more missing pieces of the faunal jigsaw will be found.  We can be sure that the  J/K interval and its faunas will remain a fascinating puzzle for years to come.]]></description>

Hi Bill, thanks so much for commenting! And yes, you&#039;re totally right. In the paper this little post is drawn from, we addressed this issue a bit (based on your own work) (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12255) and also in the follow up  too (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12737) - I think most discussion is in the SI for this one. These issues are why we elected to use the term J/K transition mostly instead of J/K boundary itself. Certainly made this PhD tougher! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Small comment.  Being more precise about siting the boundary, am not so sure significant extinctions can be detected  - certainly there is nothing like any of the major Phanerozoic extinctions .  In marine settings. just before the boundary there was a radiation of calcareous nannofossils and a marked turnover of calpionellids actually marks the J/K boundary (the Tithonian/Berriasian boundary): that is just above the old boundary level that was previously used - a level marked by a turnover in ammonite faunas (base of Jacobi Zone).  My point is this - before hunting for an extinction event at the J/K boundary, to able to identify any  faunal or floral event or extinction, it is important to remember that the base of the Cretaceous is the base of the Berriasian Stage, and that is at the base of the Calpionella alpina Zone.  And none of this can be readily identified in non-marine settings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[protohedgehog,

I am not a scientist but have read about science since very young.  I have long contemplated over the past several decades on possible causes during the KT extinction event that brought about the complete extinction of the land based dinosaurs with the exception of the birds that nested in the trees or on high cliffs.  I was just reading this very interesting paragraph by Bob Strauss dated February 18, 2018 on the internet titled &quot;Prehistoric Life During the Mesozoic&quot; that conformed with some of my speculations:

&quot;During most of the Mesozoic Era, including the Cretaceous period, mammals were sufficiently intimidated by their dinosaur cousins that they spent most of their time high up in trees or huddling together in underground burrows. Even so, some mammals had enough breathing room, ecologically speaking, to allow them to evolve to respectable sizes. One example was the 20-pound Repenomamus, which actually ate baby dinosaurs!&quot;

I have read about certain sea birds who nest on the ground and have done so throughout most of their evolutionary past on secluded rodent and pest free islands.  After the introduction of rodents to their islands by humans, it has been documented that the nesting birds are totally defenseless and seem to be blind to the rodents as the rodents literally chew and eat them and their young while they are sitting and tending their nests.  There are photos of the nesting birds with large chunks of flesh eaten out of them while they sit on their nests.  They seem to have evolved no defenses to the rodent predations.  

Could it be that mammals like Repenomamus evolved to eat the eggs and hatchlings of the land based dinosaurs while the parenting dinosaurs looked on with indifference like today&#039;s sea birds?  And that the evolutionary niche filled by Repenomamus like mammals was so unchallenged that they multiplied by the billions and helped to push all land based dinosaurs into extinction with the exception of the birds who nested in the trees and high up on steep cliffs that may have been inaccessible to Repenomamus and any other dinosaur eating mammals?  Is it possible that no land based dinosaurs made it through the KT extinctions because what dinosaurs the KT extinctions would have normally missed were finished off by mammals?  It would be ironic that the small mammals of the cretaceous helped bring down their mighty dinosaur cousins that helped pave the way for the new age of mammals.]]></description>

Hey Jim,

Ah this is awesome! I hadn&#039;t read it yet, thanks for sharing - I&#039;ll get on it! I reckon it would be really cool to do a comprehensive review of the biotic/abiotic things happening in the Early Cretaceous of North America, seems like there&#039;s so much potentially interesting things going on!

Cheers,

Jon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jon;

Protracted multiphase extinction over 25 Ma; totally with you on that. Have you had a chance to read the Cedar Mt. tome yet?   https://www.utahgeology.org/openjournal/index.php/GIW/article/view/9

For North America

Clearly big faunal turnover across J-K boundary but still an appreciable gap of  maybe 10 million years.

Much wetter climatic conditions seem to span the unconformity (link?) before the rainshadow formed by the Sevier orogeny.

There seems to be a big faunal break sometime in the medial Aptian. North America maybe larger than elsewhere as it becomes a island continent for the remainder of the Early Cret. before first Asian immigration event, with immigration induced extinction,

Ontong Java Plateau (more early Aptian) flood basalts??

More data coming relative to mammals, sauropods, and stegosaurs.

Enjoy, my friend!]]></description>
