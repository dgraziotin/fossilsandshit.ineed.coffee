					<description><![CDATA[I particularly resent the fact that I cannot even access some of my older articles in journals like Nature and that I am legally disallowed from distributing copies of my own articles to whom I please.  Researchgate provides a way I can do this - even if only posting corrected preprints that have already been posted on the arXiv.  See for example earlier discussions on this:
https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/apr/20/open-access-crucial-public-confidence-science
https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2011/09/21/academic-journals-arxiv-peter-coles/
and lots of similar blogs since then.  The journal publishing industry is worth 10&#039;s of billions of dollars yearly, and those of us who write and referee for those journals get nothing in return. (Sounds a bit like the definition of a parasite).
Researchgate is a fine platform for stimulating cross-disciplinary collaborative research.]]></description>

The lack of transparency on all things RG is its biggest downside! Still a lot of full-text in one place though, regardless of legality. Also interesting that the study found some 14% of full-text was externally hosted, with arxiv &#038; nih the largest sources. Cheers]]></description>

Hey Eoghan,

Nice detective work. As far as I can see, according to RG they still claim to have 100 million publications (fact sheet here: https://www.researchgate.net/press). So I would guess ResearchGate are (deliberately?) conflating article record with &quot;publication&quot;, as typically researchers regard publication as the full text record, and not just article metadata. You&#039;re probably right with your assessment though, and if indeed there are only ~20 million full text publications, not 100 million as I misconstrued (not deliberately), then only between 7-10% of article records would be illegally hosted, but still around half the full text corpus. ResearchGate have been quite quiet about this whole thing though.

Best,

Jon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;This means that around half, or approximately 50 million, research papers on RG are most likely illegally hosted.&quot;

Shouldn&#039;t it be around half of the non-OA fulltext available? The study says that only 19M of the 80M (circa 2015) were full-text. Assuming 20% of the 19M are gold-OA leaves about 15M non-OA fulltext, so about 7.75M illegally hosted. Presumably this has increased since 2015 if the latest figure for overall publications has increased to 100M, but I assume the % of fulltext is roughly the same. Any recent figure from RG on the number of full-text articles? Cheers, Eoghan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/illegal-file-hosting-site-researchgate-acquires-massive-financial-investment/#comment-2564&quot;&gt;Jeroen Bosman&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for this interesting comment. I certainly need to think about this more from different perspectives, but here&#039;s a simple answer for now.

I would have no problem with RG in a 100% Open world, as we probably wouldn&#039;t even need it then anymore. RG&#039;s popularity stems from it&#039;s huge corpus of freely, but often not legally, available articles (and the fact that Google Scholar links to them). My problem is that because it is simple, but illegal, it detracts from researchers &#039;doing OA right&#039;, and being lawful in the process. I can&#039;t support that sort of behaviour, no matter what I think of some scholarly publishers. I do however think there is a mismatch between the morality and legality of openly sharing research articles, but don&#039;t have a viable solution to that yet. I don&#039;t think breaking the law is it, though.

Another thing is that this shows the scale of the issue of copyright. If researchers sharing their own articles is illegal, then what the hell is copyright protecting? The profits of publishers? Because that is not what it was designed for. And it highlights the lack of understanding of the contractual obligations researchers have when signing away their rights to publishers through CTAs. Of course, in a 100% OA world where copyright is retained by authors, which I imagine is what we all want, none of this would be an issue.

Cheers!

Jon]]></description>
