					<description><![CDATA[Apparently, most of the statistical results cited in support of the conclusions of this paper (citing AIC-weights) are actually non-significant according to p-values. Therefore, the hypothesis that sea level correlate to the observed diversity changes cannot be distinguished from the absence of a relationship. 
   AIC-weights determine the best model out of those that you tested. They do not tell you whether that best model is any good or not. On their own, they cannot be used as evidence of a relationship between diversity patterns and sea level changes. 
   From my perspective, this fundamentally undermines the conclusions of the work. Jon, I&#039;d welcome any information that contradicts my reading of the results tables. At present, however, I think that this is a fairly serious misinterpretation of the results of a statisical hypothesis test.]]></description>
