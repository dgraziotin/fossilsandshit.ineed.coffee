It&#039;s a pretty common refrain, and Halstead and Sarjeant is a pretty low-key &quot;paper,&quot; such that it only gets looked at by historians.]]></description>

I hadn&#039;t read your post before, but good point! This is simply what the sources I was using indicated at the time.]]></description>

Ha, that&#039;s actually quite cool! I&#039;d be quite dubious of the results though, it&#039;s very difficult to correctly assign pathologies to things that are 65myo+. 

If it&#039;s true, totally awesome! But the final point they make about understanding the history of tumors in totally different organisms (assuming they actually are) could help modern cancer in humans is a bit of a leap of faith.

If you want a copy of that paper for a bit of Sunday evening reading material, let me know! (jon.tennant.2[at]gmail.com)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This sort of has nothing to do with the post, but you raise the point that dinosaurs will never cure cancer.  Out of curiosity, is there evidence that dinosaurs ever suffered from cancers or anything like that?  Presumably there are some soft-tissue imprints, and I guess there are some cancerous tumrs in bone.  There must be enough material by this point to have found something. . . 

Okay, I took a second to actually look it up and found this: http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=598

Dinosaur researchers get to do cool stuff.]]></description>
