This is an interesting question. We don&#039;t know how many non-scientists want to read a full paper, because most of them simply can&#039;t, which we can conflate as evidence for them not wanting to. In my experience, non-scientists usually want to try and at least attempt to read the original source for research-related things. People are always more curious than we give them credit for. Blog posts are good as summaries, but never a replacement for getting fully engrossed in a good research article! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post. I agree with a lot of it. I wonder though how many non scientists want to read a full paper? In my expereience  not many, most would rather read a well written summary blog. In which case did you really fail if you could easily direct your girlfriend to blog posts? On the other hand maybe you are right some of those people arent keen to read a full paper because they are inaccessible.]]></description>
