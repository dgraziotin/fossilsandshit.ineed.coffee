Hi,

Yeah, you  can do, but I&#039;ve just noticed I&#039;ve been naughty and not quoted the original source either - oops! You should be able to track the original on Google images, I&#039;d think..

Cheers]]></description>

Really enjoyed your post. We have a blog written about a similar theme and I&#039;m struggling to find an apt image that is under an open licence. Would it be possible to use your image of the &quot;my policy-maker doesn&#039;t understand me&quot; please? i will credit you in the blog and provide a link to your blog. Thanks, PlanetGeogBlog
TjThanks]]></description>

Yeah, he quoted that in the talk -see the storify.

Just note - I wasn&#039;t making any judgements about the current state of drugs policy with this blog. Just emphasising confusion about Nutt&#039;s approach, and almost self-obsession (something that others have revealed, not publicly). I would lurve to see cannabis legalised, trust me. And wouldn&#039;t mind seeing tighter controls on alcohol (as long as it doesn&#039;t affect the middle or upper classes though, right?). But there&#039;s a right way to do things, and a wrong way. Besides, Nutt&#039;s science is highly questionable - see upcoming post!  

The media, getting involved in politics? That&#039;s unheard of!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Favourite Nutt anecdote I heard was that he said to Jacqui Smith (or other hopeless Labour minister): &quot;I bet you don&#039;t even know what evidence even is!&quot;. She replied saying &quot;Of course I do. It&#039;s something that we find to corroborate our ideas!&quot;. Or something along those lines.

Yeah, Nutt is quite bombastic and revels in the media attention. But he is certainly right that the current drugs policy is based on nothing but idiocy, bullied into form by the media. If we were beginning a drugs policy from the beginning, we would not have it looking anything like it is. Prisons are full to the brim of young people who are criminalized through contact with recreational drugs, who then go on to commit other offenses. The horrifically misguided &quot;war on drugs&quot; has decimated economies around the world; in parts of South America, drugs cartels, responsible for mass murder in the name of drugs, would be some of the largest and most profitable companies, if only they paid tax.

No drug is safe, that much is clear. But it should be a matter of a health problem, rather than a legal problem. When new drugs become banned, deaths often increase, as people turn back to more traditional, more dangerous drugs, like heroin, crack, and alcohol. Seriously, why the hell is ecstasy just as dangerous as crack? And why is alcohol even legal? It&#039;s not based on sense!

It&#039;s not just Nutt&#039;s work that gets ignored. The government forms research advisory committees and then specifically ignores them when the results come out differently to what they wanted. Worse still is that we, as scientists, are prohibited from using them for research. The potential to understand how the brain works using these drugs to alter the brain has been completely missed.

You probably heard all of these titbits from Nutt himself. But drugs are one of those things that so many governments promise to deal with sensibly and then panic when the media flips out. The policies are not based on research whatsoever, just prejudice, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s such a mess.]]></description>
