					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Yippee! Imperial College London have signed DORA, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment! This basically means that the impact factor will no longer be used for research assessment. This follows the widespread documentation of its inherent flaws its but perplexing and continued mis-use.  This is HUGE. Impact factors will no longer be promoted, either directly or indirectly, in staff assessments. This means that people have to actually use methods that make sense when it comes to defining the structure of academia. Fancy that!&#160; [&#8230;]]]></description>
