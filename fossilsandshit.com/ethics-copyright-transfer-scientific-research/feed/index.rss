Cool, but how common is this? And how often is it violated..? And how many researchers are even aware of it, if it applies to them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I should have added that the &quot;course of employment&quot; thing is critical. If you write a cookery book but your employment is studying velociraptors and shit, the cookery book belongs to you not the employer. But if your University requires you to research and publish, then it looks hard to argue that the resulting works are not made in the course of employment! So they belong to the University, so only the University can transfer the copyright.

Of course the publishers would argue that the first author is acting as an agent of the University in so doing. But I doubt you are empowered to enter into other contracts on behalf of the University!]]></description>

OK, IANAL and Wikipedia is not a fully reliable source. But see the Ownership section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_Kingdom. Note:

&quot;Works created in the course of employment[edit]

&quot;Where the apparent creator of the work composed it in the course of employment, the employer is treated as the first owner of the copyright.[10] It is important to distinguish between works which are created whilst one is an employee, and works created whilst one is acting in the course of employment. It is only in the latter case that the exception applies.

&quot;It is possible for contracts of employment to contain express assignment clauses or to otherwise deal with the ownership of any intellectual property rights created by an employee.&quot;

Note, AFAIK few if any academic employment contracts in the UK contain express clauses assigning ownership of the copyright to the academic. You could check your own, for instance.

I was also struck by this earlier paragraph that I had not noted before:

&quot;Joint authorship[edit]

&quot;If more than one person qualifies as an author then a work is one of joint authorship. Under the 1988 Act, a work of joint authorship is a work &quot;produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of each author is not distinct from that of the other author or authors&quot;.[16] Where the work is one of joint authorship, the consent of all copyright holder is required to avoid liability for infringement.&quot;

Bearing in mind that many of the &quot;authors&quot; of multi-author academic articles have contributed precisely nothing to the actual text (the only thing copyrighted), as opposed to the work that preceded the text, then the transfer of copyright by the &quot;first author&quot; or &quot;corresponding author&quot; looks dodgy. I guess if all the actual co-authors had signed a document empowering the first author so to do, it would be OK.

On the face of it, many past &quot;copyright transfers&quot; may be invalid, or at least challengeable!]]></description>

It&#039;s a mostly USA thing:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_for_hire
The matter is mostly studied in relationship to open access mandates (whether they are legal, how far they can go etc.), for instance:
https://www.rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/harvard_policy_open_access.pdf

In EU, the most common legal argument is around academic freedom (which is enshrined in the Italian and German constitutions due to experience with fascism), see e.g.:
http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1807

Other than that, the most relevant laws may be others, such as labour laws and public administration laws. For instance, in Italy art. 53 D.Lgs. 165/2001 applies: full-time professors cannot have additional jobs (not even consultancy) unless approved. It could be argued that academics working for proprietary private journals, possible even if unpaid, need to seek authorisation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I believe that under copyright law (and IANAL), the copyright in works made in the course of employment (works made for hire) belong to the employer. Thus it would appear the author does not have the legal right to sign away that copyright. Hence most such copyright transfers made by researchers should arguably be invalid!

However, this is another of those &#039;inconvenient truths&#039;. It is &#039;customary&#039; to regard most research writing by academics as belonging to those academics rather than their university employers, although there is not very often a formal policy on this* (oddly, not so much the case for the potentially much more valuable IP in patents). Where universities have attempted to enforce this, there has generally been a strong kick-back from the community. Whether it is either legal or ethical for authors to sign away copyrights that they only have a customary (rather than legal) right to, is an interesting question!

* I believe JISC commissioned a paper on this many years ago, maybe early 2000s, which it would be interesting to repeat.]]></description>
