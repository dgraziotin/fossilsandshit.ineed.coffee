Thanks for your comment, Dahlia! You might be interested in the Blockchain for Peer Review project: https://www.blockchainpeerreview.org/2019/06/next-steps-for-the-blockchain-for-peer-review-initiative/ as well as this recent paper on Blockchain technology in Open Science more broadly: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00016/full and then there is also the Blockchain for Science project which contains a lot of active projects in this space, some including peer review I think: https://www.blockchainforscience.com - enjoy! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very cool series you have here. I found your blog by googling &quot;blockchain peer review&quot; to see if anyone else has had this idea. I was very excited to support a similar blockchain peer review project called Lunyr but unfortunately it seems that that project has been abandoned. My close to finishing a PhD and my limited experience with the peer-review process has been... eye-opening to say the least. Realising reviewers don&#039;t get paid and that it takes a long time to get a decision from a journal. It all feels very inefficient. I like the idea of using blockchain and AI to improve that.]]></description>
