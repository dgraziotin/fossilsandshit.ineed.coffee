					<description><![CDATA[I forwarded this to Jerry Coyne&#039;s website-not-a-blog, since it might interest his readers, but here&#039;s my several cents worth :

I&#039;m not enough of a dinosaur anatomist (elsewhere on the Web I uses a signature that &quot;Birds are not dinosaur descendants; birds are dinosaurs, for all useful meanings of &quot;birds&quot;, &quot;are&quot; and &quot;dinosaurs&quot;) to know the anatomical details of the various contrivances used by extant dinosaurs to &quot;lactate&quot;, but I&#039;d be moderately sanguine about the chances of finding anatomical evidence of what would probably need to be fairly substantial excretory glands, whereever they&#039;re situated. Mention of the often fat-rich composition of such &quot;extant dinosaur milk&quot; makes me think that the geochemists might have a fighting chance with that sort of idea. And in my memory I have a circa 1996 (1998 actually) report of a well-preserved theropod dinosaur from Sicily which had a large stain in it&#039;s upper thorax which was interpreted at the time as a possible mark of the heart position, but which might bear re-consideration in the light of this.
... searching.
I name things in my &quot;paper mound&quot; so that you can find the reference by reading the file name :&quot;Nature-392-0383-Exceptional-soft-tissue-preservation-in-a-theropod-dinosaur-from-Italy.PDF&quot; [journal]-[volume]-[page]-[title].[format] 
It&#039;s a beast called &quot;Scipionyx&quot;, from southern Italy not Sicily, and it&#039;s got a belly full of organ remains, but in the throat region structures interpreted as &quot;pectoral musculature&quot; and &quot;trachea?&quot;.
So ... you don&#039;t need access to the wonderful preservation of the Chinese material.
