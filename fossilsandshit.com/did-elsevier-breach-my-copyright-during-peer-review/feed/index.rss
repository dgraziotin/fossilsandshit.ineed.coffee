I would just contact everyone at the journal until you receive a response. Which reminds me, I need to poke Elsevier again about this..]]></description>

It wasn&#039;t someone at Publons - it&#039;s an automatic feature of the platform as a function of Elsevier&#039;s policy. The implicit restriction passes through as an explicit policy. I spoke with Publons about this during the Wiley incident, and the resolution was to follow it up with the Editor, which I have done in this case and that one too!]]></description>

Jon, if you had permission from the author to post it, then it&#039;s not against Elsevier&#039;s policy. If someone at Publons told you so, they misspoke. Perhaps you should follow up with them?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/did-elsevier-breach-my-copyright-during-peer-review/#comment-2440&quot;&gt;Catriona Fennell, Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Catriona,

Thanks for taking the time to comment!

I was aware of the guidelines, but as you say, confidentiality is just something that is &#039;expected&#039; or implied, not anything that&#039;s actually ever agreed to. Simply saying &#039;but it says so on our website&#039; is exactly why I put the thing about £10,000 on my site - it carries the same amount of weight in this argument. Therefore if I have implicitly agreed to a confidential process without signing anything, Elsevier have also agreed to my £10,000 reviewer fee. The same sorts of considerations must apply both ways in this case, and at the very least these things should be made much more explicit prior to any acceptance to review in the future. And, as Charles mentions above, this does not give Elsevier the authority to inhibit my personal use of my work either via Publons or anywhere else.

Best,

Jon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon, 

I can confirm that Elsevier does not ask or expect peer reviewers to transfer copyright. You wrote the review and you own the copyright in your review.
However, your question raises a number of fascinating issues, as reflected in this discussion hosted by COPE:
http://publicationethics.org/files/u7140/Who_Owns_Peer_Reviews_Discussion_Document_Web.pdf
The posting of reviewer reports of published papers has well-proven benefits, of course, as first shown by BioMedCentral and EMBO, and more recently by you and your colleagues at ScienceOpen and Elsevier&#039;s open peer review pilot, amongst others: https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers-update/story/innovation-in-publishing/is-open-peer-review-the-way-forward.
The increased transparency and recognition to reviewers have inspired us to greatly expand our pilot and our goal is for reviewer reports to be posted in all Elsevier journals.

In the meantime, while the majority of Elsevier journals - including
Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology- follow single or double-blind review, our overall guidelines reflect that https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/how-to-conduct-a-review. Authors publishing in such journals may well expect the reviewer confidentiality that applied before publication to continue after publication. So I would expect that most Editors would want to check with the authors first before a review appears publicly, just in case there are any sensitivities e.g. your review covers content from an earlier version of the paper that isn&#039;t publicly available.

All the best,
Catriona]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fossilsandshit.com/did-elsevier-breach-my-copyright-during-peer-review/#comment-2438&quot;&gt;Charles Oppenheim&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Charles,

Thanks for your insight on this. Just to comment on your comments:

1. I agree.
2. That makes sense, Publons have to comply with publisher policies as they don&#039;t want to upset their clients/potential clients with these things.
3. The &#039;claim&#039; of a fee was pre-emptive, in case Elsevier responded with something like &#039;But you agreed to the terms on our website implicitly by accepting..&#039;, in which case I could simply say &#039;Well then you agreed to mine too.&#039; We&#039;ll see how that one plays out. They can&#039;t have it both ways.
4. I think this makes sense, unless the paper becomes published. Once that happens, the authors names are identified anyway, and Publons works by simply using CrossRef DOIs to bring everything together. I would never dream of publishing a review without the paper itself being published, as that&#039;s just not cool. 
5. I think this issue of moral rights is still kinda important. When I had this issue with Wiley, although we ultimately agreed I was &#039;right&#039;, I didn&#039;t publish the report in the end as I didn&#039;t get a unanimous vote from the authors to do so after I raised the issue with them and the Editor.

Cheers! And have fun with the journalist :)
