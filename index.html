	<h1>Mirror of Jon Tennant's website - Green Tea and Velociraptors</h1>
	<p>
		The website at <a href="https://fossilsandshit.ineed.coffee/fossilsandshit.com/index.html">https://fossilsandshit.ineed.coffee/fossilsandshit.com</a> contains a mirror of the publicly available files of 
		Jon Tennant's website, <a href="http://fossilsandshit.com">Green Tea and Velociraptors</a>, also <a href="http://fossilsandshit.com">http://fossilsandshit.com</a>.

	<p>
		Due to how the Web and JavaScript work, some functionality is broken as not all scripts could be included in the mirror. But all content is there. All his posts are available at <a href="https://fossilsandshit.ineed.coffee/fossilsandshit.com/blog/index.html">/fossilsandshit.com/blog/index.html</a>.
